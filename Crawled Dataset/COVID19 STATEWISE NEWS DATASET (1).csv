The app is developed on the guidelines laid out by the WHO, and asks 15 questions to the subject. The subject is then asked to cough into the microphone of the smartphone. “Based on the answers to the questionnaire and the coughing sound, the app generates a rating on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being the highest risk level. The app then suggests a risk level based on the data,” Mr. Jain said. According to him, assessing the sickness based on the coughing sound is a proven technique and Salcit has an associated patent also called ‘A system for analysing risk associated with cough sounds’. Salcit-Zensark is already in discussions with government health departments, he said. “The app accomplishes screening and assessment, and has the ability to simultaneously screen and surveil tens of thousands of subjects and monitors the condition of individuals,” Mr. Jain said."

He, however, said that the Maoists would not hesitate to retaliate any offensive from the security forces, as a self protection measure.In the message, the Maoist leader asked the security forces not to indulge in combing operation but instead focus on saving people from the pandemic. He also said that since January, the security forces engaged in anti-Maoist operation both on the Andhra and Odisha side have stepped up the offensive and have been conducting area domination exercise even during the testing time of COVID-19.He accused the forces for excesses in Jodambo area of Odisha and in Koyyuru, Pedabayalu and GK Veedhi mandals in the Visakha Agency.A letter with similar content was released by Kailsam, secretary of AOBSZC.

If they were really keen on focusing on COVID-19, they would not have killed 17 CRPF men and injuring another 14, in an ambush on March 21, in Sukma region in Chhattisgarh, said a senior officer engaged in anti-Maoist operation in AOB.“The fact is that their area of domination is fast shrinking in Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Andhra, and they want a window to re-establish themselves,” he said.“In the AOB region, their area of operation has been curtailed to about just 1,500 sq km in the cut-off region. Both the BSF on the Odisha side and A.P. Police and CRPF have made deep inroads on the Andhra side. This is hurting the Maoist in a big way, as armed outposts are springing up in short periods in their territory,” said a senior officer from AP SIB.The area domination by the security forces was aimed at instilling confidence among the tribal people. “Moreover, due to our deep forays into the inhospitable terrain, government schemes have started to reach the tribal people and they are getting road and telecommunication connectivity. “And that is why tribal people are no longer swaying to the tune of the LWE, which affecting their (Maoist) tribal base,” said a senior police officer."

With her husband, a painter, left without a source of income due to the lockdown, she is now wondering how much longer their family can sustain themselves.“We have two daughters. As five electricity consumer numbers have been seeded to our Aadhaar, we have been deprived of benefits being given by the government to beneficiaries,” Radha told The Hindu on Wednesday.She was one among many who vented out their woes at the APEPDCL office in Pandimetta for being left out of government benefits after multiple electricity service numbers were erroneously seeded to their name.The State Government, due to the COVID-19 crisis, has decided to give 20 kg rice and one kg of red gram free to the white card-holders. This apart, ₹1,000 cash benefit is also given. Selection of beneficiaries for house-sites has also been finalised.The ward secretariat has informed Lanka Raju, an auto-rickshaw driver, that his ration card will be cancelled as three power connections were seeded to his Aadhaar number.“I have been deprived of government benefits due to this problem,” Lanka Raju bemoaned.

Bhaskar Rao, who works at an automobile showroom.“I was given a house under the Rajiv Gruhakalpa scheme at Marikivalasa when the Congress was in power in erstwhile united Andhra Pradesh.

The reason being cited is that I apparently own three houses as three electricity service connections are seeded to my Aadhaar number,” he said.When contacted, an official of APEPDCL clarified that at the time of distribution of LED bulbs, some persons might have fraudulently claimed the bulbs by citing Aadhaar numbers of other individuals. Some tenants were also given bulbs against service numbers referred by them.He said service numbers not linked to them could be removed easily by submitting an application at the electricity revenue office concerned."

The animals, otherwise, gather their feed from the local shandies, small markets, and the offerings made by the locals at temples.

On Wednesday, a total of 40,000 lumps were bought and auctioned. “With the market starved of stocks since March 24, the arrivals were lapped up in no time,” said trader Korukonda Butchiraju.Instead of the usual process of 50 to 70 lumps being kept in one lot, 2,000 to 3,000 lumps were kept and after a cursory look, the auction was completed in an hour, it was learnt. While the low-end varieties got a price of ₹ 305 (for 10 kg), the superior varieties commanded up to ₹370, which is ₹10 to ₹15 more than the rate at which the market closed previously. About 80 farmers brought their produce to the market, a major one for jaggery in these parts of the country with a turnover of ₹100 crore. “It will take at least three days for the lumps to be stocked after weighing and taking measures like sewing them up in gunny bags,” said Mr. Butchiraju.One of the reasons for the stock being lapped up is the upcountry demand, particularly from the markets in Odisha, sources said."

For a couple of days the flow of results could be slow until the VLMs and VTMs reach Anantapur, Visakhapatnam and other districts with high incidence of positive cases.Presumptive testing stoppedThe COVID-19 presumptive testing has been stopped at the RDT Bathalapalli Negative Pressure Laboratory as it was waiting for the medium to land. Going by the assurances given by the State TB Control authorities, A.P. had only 2,000 units with them. So it had ordered 10,000 more and would ensure landing of these VLM and VTM cartridges by Thursday afternoon so that testing of samples could be started again by the early hours of Friday.While the VTM cartridges need to be tested in Bio-Safe Negative Pressure Laboratory or a Virology Laboratory, the VLM cartridges can be used anywhere - places where the concentration of likely positive cases is more. In Anantapur district, Hindupur being the hotspot of COVID-19 cases, the administration is planning to deploy all its 18 TrueNAT machines available in the district at Hindupur, Anantapur and Kadiri.Pooled testing: a cost and time saverA ray of hope, however, is ICMR’s likely approval to pooled samples testing, to save precious testing resources in the country. “If the ICMR approves it, six samples can be tested at one go. Only if the sample turns positive, all of them are tested individually. Otherwise a lot of time and money can be saved,” opines Bathalapalli laboratory head Raghu Prakash Reddy.The samples in TrueNAT machines with VLM cartridges destroys the virus after the test, thus posing no problem. Testing can be done in an open environment also instead of a sealed virology laboratory needed for a VTM cartridge."

The relaxation of a few hours in the morning is meant to enable people to buy essential items. The relaxation is definitely not meant to be used as an opportunity to hit the road for jogging,” said a police officer from IV Town Police Station.Police have already started booking cases against people who are coming out on the road for walking or jogging in defiance of the lockdown.On April 20 and 21, IV Town police have booked cases against several persons who were found jogging on the streets despite strict instructions to remain indoors.“Except for buying essentials during the allotted timings in the morning, or in case of an emergency, people should not come out of their homes at all. Going out for a walk or to exercise is strictly not allowed,” said another police officer, wondering how these ‘health-conscious’ people were willing to put themselves as well as their families at risk of contracting coronavirus.Growing trendPolice said that with the lockdown being extended, they are witnessing a growing number of people coming out for walks. People are venturing out for walks even in the evening, and on some days are outnumbering the morning walkers, said police.“With the closure of gyms and parks, many citizens are going for jogs in their localities. What shocks us is that people are walking in groups, totally ignoring social distancing norms,” said a police officer posted at Arilova police station.Police said that many of those who go for walks are educated members of society, who are aware of the consequences of defying the lockdown.“Some say that they are diabetic and sitting idle at home will lead to health issues. Some say that they are just walking in front of their house or in their street,” said a policeman from Madhurawada zone.Strict actionDeputy Commissioner of Police (Zone I) S.

This solution and humidifier using nanotechnology ensures a 10 to 12 micron layer is formed and within seven seconds of a person’s stay / passing through it, effective disinfection happens.The centrifugal humidifier uses a motorised air blower that has an in-built storage tank. About the advantage of the humidifier, Sugardana promoter Karthik Narayan told The Hindu that it uses only one-third of the solution needed in a disinfectant tunnel. An eight-feet sprinkler tunnel uses seven litres to nine litres of diluted solution per hour, whereas a humidifier uses only two to three litres, he said.The humidifier has been connected to a 20-litre overhead tank that keeps on refilling the built-in storage of the machine. It can cover an area of 2,500 square feet, but the chamber is closed on both ends with flexible blinds, is 8 feet x 4 feet and 8 feet tall. District COVID-19 Special Officer K.

Pitchaiah, a salt farmer from Motumala village near Kothapatnam, was hoping to get decent returns during this summer.Now his hopes have been completely dashed in the wake of the lockdown in two spells announced by the Centre to combat coronavirus. Workers have not turned up at his salt pan for more than a month now to scrap salt and move it to safety.‘’I am also unable to engage truck to move the produced salt in view of the lockdown in force,’’ laments the salt producer doing all that he could to move the scrapped salt to a godown nearby on his own amid the threat of a downpour.The lockdown has come at most inopportune time as it was during April and May that salt production reaches the peak, explains another salt farmer Thambi Srinivasulu taking a short recess to talk to The Hindu . ‘’I am not in a position to break even after spending ₹45,000 per acre for salt extraction this year,’’ he says.The wet spell twice during April has also brought misery to them. Another salt producer G. Raghava says ‘’every time rains occur salt production is held up for about 10 days.’’Plea to govt. Another farmer, K. Brahamanada Reddy, wants the State government to purchase salt from them and give it to people under the public distribution system. MGNREGS should be dovetailed with salt extraction works like for formation of field channels, strengthening of bunds and stamping of land for them to get some relief as severe labour shortage hit salt extraction.“We are also ready to supply salt fortified with iodine to get a better rate for our produce,’’ they say and plead for institutional credit for processing the salt widely used in tanneries and chemical industrial units.The power tariff, which used to be just 40 paise during the regime of the then Chief Minister, Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy, had gone up to ₹4.75 per unit as the government treated the sector as industry. The government should consider reducing the power tariff to at least ₹1.25 per unit charged for aquaculture units, demands Kothapatnam Salt Producers Cooperative Society president K. Nanchariah.Over 2000 small and marginal farmers extract salt for six months in, among other mandals, Motumala, Biramkonda and Kothapatnam in Prakasam district till the onset of southwest monsoon and get on an average ₹100 per bag of 75 kg in summer and double the amount during rainy days."

Dubey told The Hindu. Leveraging their proprietary Internet of Things-based sensors and artificial intelligence, the solution can augment existing apps like Aarogya Setu by expanding their reach to smartphones without apps, dumb phones and wearables such as smartwatches and headsets.Xinthe Technologies CEO, an alumnus of IIT-Madras, Sridhar Panuganti, said: “XACT can be easily deployed in all public offices, airports, railway stations, bus stations, hotels and malls as we have the solution ready today and we are eager to extend our bit to help the world during the pandemic.”He said XACT could predict outbreaks, hotspots and red zones before their occurrence giving health service teams an edge in their plans to fight the menace. XACT can trace an infected area for a number of days beyond the contact-event.Health monitoringPrimary investigator of XACT Srikant Jakilinki said: “Beyond contact-tracing, XACT can potentially monitor the health of the traced contacts (heart-rate, temperature, blood and oxygen) from wearables and ensure the traced contacts and the public at large follow quarantine rules by integrating XACT with GIS expertise of Xinthe. Also, by applying the data science of predictive-analytics at big data scale, the IT firm is confident that XACT can trace the spread of the virus itself and have utility even after COVID-19 pandemic.

The hill town of Tirumala, Tirupati city downhill and nearby Tiruchanur collectively have 250 kalyana mandapams and convention halls.

Saikumar Reddy of Blue Petal Events.While many families decided to conduct the weddings at home in a simple affair, those planning for a lavish wedding decided to postpone the event till the lockdown is completely lifted.“We used to get 7-8 weddings a month during the normal season, with the number rising to 15 during this auspicious March-April season. Many weddings have been cancelled while some were held in private.

He expects the bleak situation to continue.On a much smaller scale, the ‘Nadaswaram’ players, garland makers, photographers, priests and small caterers with a team of three cooks and ten servers are struggling to make ends meet. As most of them are in the unorganised sector, there is neither an assured income, nor a livelihood source to fall back on during such times.Even if the lockdown is lifted as announced, the industry is not expected to look up immediately, as the ensuing period is considered unsuitable, if not entirely inauspicious, for performing weddings."

Phaniprakash told The Hindu.‘Pocket-friendly’Fish lovers are very happy as during the lockdown the consumption has gone up steeply and they have not felt the absence of sea fish. Due to the 62-day annual ban, mechanised boats are not venturing into the sea.“We are very happy as the prices of prawns (small size) and Rohu are wallet-friendly,” said Prantik Mukherjee of the Bengali Association, Waltair.While prawn is available for ₹250 per kg, Ruhu is sold at ₹200. “Roopchand, a fish brought from Bhimavaram, is sold like hotcakes in the Gajuwaka area. It looks and tastes like pomfret and is priced at ₹200 to ₹250 per kg,” Ummidi Nalini, a vendor, said.A large quantity of fish from the Godavari captured near Kakinada is also finding its way to the city. Market watchers say curbs imposed on vehicle transport during the lockdown is also preventing many traders from transporting the perishable item in reefers to overseas destinations in container ships and lorries to the northeastern States.Vendors benefitThe situation is helping the vendors make both ends meet during the lockdown.“As margins are low, the State government should give a cash compensation of ₹10,000 to all the vendors,” said Arjili Dasu, executive director of the A.P. Fisherfolk Foundation. He hailed the decision to credit money to the bank accounts of those hit by annual ban by Wednesday under the YSR Matsyakara Bharosa scheme.Sea fish rates have seen an abnormal increase in the city as it is supplied only by the traditional fishermen for whom the annual ban is not applicable as they go for fishing in catamarans."

Tech courses for the year 2019-20.“GO 15 is the prerogative of the government. The fee reimbursement and fee fixation have been done based on the recommendations of the Higher Education Monitoring and Regulatory Commission.

But a few colleges are not happy .”He said the fee regulatory commission was a statutory body created by enacting a law in the Assembly and headed by Justice Eeswariah, and the fixation of fee was based on scientific analysis. “We will not encourage the commercialisation of education. The promise on full fee reimbursement is part of Navaratnalu and the government is determined to fulfil it,” he said.He also said it was unfortunate that instead of appreciating the spirit behind the move, some people were opposing it, but “we’ll approach the court again and keep our word given to the students and parents.”"

Once the dust settles down, a survey should be conducted to assess the skills these migrant labourers might have and they should be absorbed in the workforce accordingly,” he said. He also expressed distress over the social media being replete with “fake news” and malicious content that tended to stigmatise individuals and communities.

The portal has been named after the state-run CSMCL (Chhattisgarh State Marketing Corporation Limited), which controls the sale of liquor in the State, a public relations department official here said.Also read | Liquor shops open, then shut again The liquor shops, which were closed since March 23, opened from Monday across the State, except in the COVID-19 containment zones and shopping malls, following the Centre’s decision to ease some curbs during the lockdown. A large number of people queued up outside liquor outlets in the State capital Raipur and other districts, defying the physical distancing norms.Also read | Social distancing goes for a toss as hundreds queue up at wine shops in Visakhapatnam“The State government has given permission for online sale of liquor so that crowding at wine shops can be discouraged,” the official said. People can book orders directly through the CSMCL website or its mobile app available on the Play Store. However, the home delivery facility will not be available in Raipur and Korba districts which are not classified as green zones, the official said. The Centre has classified districts as red, orange and green zones based on the COVID-19 risk profiling. People will have to register their mobile number, Aadhaar number and address for placing the order online which will be confirmed through an OTP (one time password). A customer can order up to 5,000 ml of liquor at a time for home delivery, the official said, adding that the delivery charge is ₹120. The main opposition BJP termed the State government’s decision of home delivery of liquor as “shameful” and demanded that it be withdrawn.“The Congress, which came to power, after promising to ban liquor is now delivering liquor at home. It is a very shameful decision,” Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Dharamlal Kaushik said."

Of the three new patients, two men, one from Raipur and another from Bhilai (Durg), have been admitted to the isolation ward of AIIMS, he said.

Earlier on Wednesday, two persons, a 26-year-old woman from Raipur and a 26-year-old man from Rajnandgaon, with recent foreign travel history, were found positive for the deadly virus. Last week, a 24-year-old woman, who had returned to Raipur from London, was the first confirmed case of coronavirus in the State. “Of the six, four are admitted at AIIMS in Raipur while the two others are undergoing treatment at government hospitals at their respective places,” a health official said, adding that they all are under continuous medical observation. Meanwhile, the State public relations department has asked Chhattisgarh-based journalists, who attended the press conference of former Madhya Pradesh Chief Minister Kamal Nath in Bhopal on March 20, to stay in self-quarantine and immediately contact health officials.

202,Chhattisgarh,"April 09, 2020 21:02 IST",Other States,NEW DELHI,Chhattisgarh CM Baghel blames Centre for COVID-19 outbreak,"The country could have been spared of all the problems arising out of the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak if the Union government had quarantined all those coming from abroad, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said on April 9.Though Chattisgarh was among the States with lowest reported COVID-19 cases, Mr. Baghel said, a final decision to lift the three-week lockdown would be taken only after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meeting with Chief Ministers on April 11.“We are looking forward to the Centre's response on April 11 on the extension of the lockdown, and thereafter, a meeting of the Chhattisgarh Cabinet will be held on April 12 to decide the future course of action,” Mr. Baghel said. “There should be more discussions with the States and their views should be taken by the Centre before arriving at a decision on the lockdown extension.”So far, Chhattisgarh has seen only 11 positive cases, with 9 of them being discharged. The last positive one was found on Wednesday with a history of coming in contact with persons who attended the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi.Mr. Baghel said that had the Centre taken the COVID-19 seriously, the country may have been spared from an extensive outbreak. “Had the government stopped international flights and kept all those coming to the country in quarantine, this virus could not have spread across the country and a lot of problems people are facing today could have been averted.” Tablighi Jamaat event Asked about Tablighi Jamaat event being perceived as a ‘super carrier,’ he said no religious colour should be given to it. He, however, did not give a clean chit to the organisers of the Nizamuddin congregation.“If international passengers from hotspots have been stopped, the congregation could also not have happened. I am not giving a clean chit to any organisation. I am not saying they are innocent. But the government had the list of all those coming from abroad. It should have identified and quarantined them,” he said.Mr. Baghel claimed that his government ordered the closure of schools, colleges and cinema halls as early as March 13 even though the first case was reported on March 18, and almost immediately sealed the borders with seven neighbouring States.“We also noticed that people who returned from the United Kingdom showed symptoms of this disease. Thereafter, we home-quarantined 2,100 people who had a history of foreign travel,” he said. Even now, nearly 76,000 people across the State were under home quarantine.The Chief Minister said his government would carry out Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s suggestion of extensive and random testing. “In some cases, people have tested positive two months after they have returned from abroad,” he said.Mr. Baghel listed out the welfare measures taken by his government for the vulnerable sections of society. The Centre should provide funds to the States as they were in the forefront of the battle against COVID-19, he added."
203,Chhattisgarh,"April 17, 2020 16:04 IST",National,New Delhi,"Coronavirus | Chhattisgarh to start pool testing in couple of days, says Singh Deo","Chhattisgarh will start pool sample testing for COVID-19 in a couple of days, state’s Health Minister T S Singh Deo said on Friday, while ruing the Modi government’s “conservative” testing strategy instead of an “aggressive” approach, which would have put the country in a much better position to fight the pandemic.COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in IndiaIn an interview to PTI, Mr. Deo also said the Chhattisgarh government is in the process of procuring 75,000 rapid testing kits on its own and has also asked the Centre for providing some.“We have re-tendered for 75,000 kits on Thursday. We have also appealed to the Central government (for giving us kits) which I hear is to get a tranche of about 6,40,000 kits from abroad. Chhatisgarh is one of those states where we don’t have even a single kit today,” Mr. Deo said.The Centre is likely to send rapid testing kits to the state by Saturday, he said. However, he was not aware of the number being sent.Also read: Coronavirus | India receives 5 lakh rapid COVID-19 testing kits from ChinaHe also asserted that the personal protective equipment (PPE) for medical personnel, including doctors and nurses, dealing directly with COVID-19 patients was in short supply.On the state set to adopt pool testing, Mr. Deo said, “We were one of those states asking for it. On Tuesday, the ICMR cleared this. We have talked to the laboratories at AIIMS and the medical college (Pt Jawahar Lal Nehru Memorial Medical College) in Raipur. They are in agreement that they will be able to do it,” he said.AIIMS Raipur has a capacity of 350-400 sample tests in a day and with pool testing it can go up to 2,000, while the Raipur medical college has about 100-120 samples capacity which would be able to go up to 500-600 in a day, he said, adding that “the pool testing would start within a day or two.”Pooling of samples involves testing them in batches and when pooled sample tests positive, then individual samples are assessed. Pool testing reduces the number of test kits used, and therefore, increases testing capacity.Asked about former Congress president Rahul Gandhi’s assertion on ramping up testing, Mr. Deo said it has to be the way forward because if one is not testing aggressively then it is like being in a “dark room” and working on speculation.He said different protocols are being followed around the world and while one advocated a lockout, the other was testing and regulating movement.Also read: Coronavirus | Amit Shah intervention made ICMR expand labs for testing COVID-19“Between South Korea and India, South Korea has tested about 7,000 per million, while India, I don’t think it would have touched even 200 per million, so that is the gap....It is easier not to have a lockdown if you have a more aggressive testing protocol. Then you are more aware of where to prevent people from moving around and where to allow people to be much freer to move around,” Deo said.“The testing protocol (adopted by the Centre) was very conservative. The entire testing protocol in the country was with only one facility initially, NIV (National Institute of Virology), Pune. Now we have 220 labs. So either the government was not prepared or not planning,” he alleged.Mr. Deo said that selective testing created a “big gap” between the asymptomatic population and those tested, and that was one of the reasons for the spread of the virus.On Chhattisgarh having fewer number of cases and zero death, the minister said the key was that the State started preparations early and then luck also played its part.“We did start early, that is true. We started on January 27 by putting in the rapid task force headed by the district collectors so that the inter-department coordination would be there as just the health department would not have been able to ensure compliance (of protocols) beyond a point,” he said.“We are fortunate to have had only 33 cases, so I would give a lot to chance, a lot to luck, maybe our people have been alert. We have had a large population that has been under quarantine, Wednesday’s figures were 94,795 in home quarantine and 242 in government quarantine facilities,” he said.Malls, cinema halls, and other business institutions were also asked to regulate activities or close down early in the state, he said.“Between January 27 to March 24, we had tried to put an administrative system in place which had identified COVID dedicated facilities and training of manpower .We started screening people coming in at the airport from January 28,” he said.“It was very difficult at the bus stand and railway stations so we went for hoardings, billboards and jingles (for COVID-19 precautions). The idea was to educate the people because from day one it was absolutely clear that there was no cure, no medicine, that we could provide to the people,” he said.The government had to try and contain the virus’ spread, he added.According to the state government, there were 33 cases of coronavirus, out of which 23 people have been discharged or cured and there have been zero fatalities due to the pandemic in the State.The minister also said there was no early standardisation of the PPE kits for COVID-19 and the Indian Council of Medical Research ( ICMR) published its standard for such kits only on March 24.“We had placed our orders on March 5 for PPEs to government subsidiary HLL for 7,000 kits and subsequently for another 7,000 kits on March 16. Out of those 14,000 kits we ordered, the firm could supply us only 3,000,” Mr. Deo said.These items are in short supply and it is not clear to manufacturers in the country as to what standard of PPE kits they have to supply for COVID-19, the senior minister in the Chhattisgarh government said.Asserting that the pandemic should serve as a wake up call for governments across the globe and they should commit at least 3 percent of the GDP to the health sector, he said there must be a sustained investment in the public health sector, he said.Deo also said the state government has asked the Centre for an automated DNA/RNA machine for sample procurement, noting that currently it is being done on a manual basis. If they provide us with this machine then the capacity doubles, the minister added."

Instead, they are arranging to quarantine the “outsiders” — local residents who went out to work — in the periphery of the village.List of what is and what is not allowed after April 20The umbrella organisation of the tribals, Sarva Adivasi Samaj (SAS), is in the forefront of the initiative and Maoists are cooperating actively. Not one case of Corona contraction has been reported from the Bastar division that has a population of about three million.It is the time of the year when thousands from the districts of south Chhattisgarh’s Bastar Division walk all the way to Telengana or the Andhra Pradesh border to pluck chilly. Following the lockdown, “hundreds returned to their village,” said the vice-president of SAS in Bastar Division, Dhiraj Rada.The tribals kept the outsiders away from the village without being hostile.“In the forest, under a banyan tree, in a school or Anganwadi (rural children’s day care), the villagers set up a shack to house their returning friends and family members. Ration is provided during the quarantine period,” said Mr. Rada.State Helpline numbers | State-wise tracker for COVID-19 casesCheck posts have been set up to keep them at the periphery of the forest villages. Police posts are on the main road.“Trainings are conducted so that health activists can run awareness campaigns in Gondi and Halbi, two key languages of Bastar,” Mr. Rada said.Maoist supportHe, however, claims that it would have been impossible to carry out the programme without the support of the Maoists. “Party people gave us access to forest villages. Usually they do not let us go into areas they control,” he said. He believes that village Sarpanches have had a word with the party people.“Maoists, of course, realised that COVID may affect them as well,” Mr. Rada said.Tribal leader of the Bharatiya Janata Party and former MP Nandkumar Sai and Bastar journalists, Kamal Shukla and Mangal Kunjam, all admitted that “without the tacit support of the Maoists smooth quarantine management would have been impossible.Inspector General (IG) of Bastar Range Sundarraj P., however, disagrees.“The initiative is not influenced by the Maoists. Tribals have a traditional practice of restricting unnecessary movement from one village to another during festivals, which has helped,” asserted Mr Sundarraj. While the forces were monitoring vehicular movements in urban and rural areas, tribals had managed the quarantine well inside the forest, he said.Naxals not regrouping“There were claims in the social media that the naxalas are regrouping during the lock down period. That is not correct,” Mr. Sundarraj said. The reason, he said, was a continuous search operation called Gast.“If the forces do not dominate areas, then chances are that the naxals will take advantage of the lockdown. They continued with their attacks and our operations are continuing too.” While the number of naxals would not dramatically come down in an area, it was not increasing either, he said.“There is absolutely no additional movement [of naxals] or regrouping. Rather, their hardship increased as it is difficult to access food or medicine,” the IG said.Mr. Rada too indicated that there was indeed some food supply problem in the civilian areas in far flung villages, which the administration was trying to address."
205,Chhattisgarh,"April 23, 2020 02:45 IST",National,New Delhi,Let there be no illusion that COVID-19 will go after May 3: Chhattisgarh Health Minister,"No one should be under any illusion that COVID-19 will disappear on May 3 when the second phase of the lockdown ends and we should learn to live with it, Chhattisgarh Health Minister T.S. Singh Deo said at a press conference organised by the Congress through videoconference. Rajasthan Health Minister Raghu Sharma, too, spoke at the press conference. “The lockdown, at best, can manage to control the spread to some extent, but we should know that the novel coronavirus is not going to go. A huge population will get infected with the virus, we should be ready for it. We should learn to live with it,” Mr. Deo said. He said the 40-day lockdown should be treated as a training period. “We will have to use the precautions that we have adopted now in the days to come,” he said. Mr. Deo said experts advised his government that in Chhattisgarh, at least 10% of the population would be infected, but only 80% of this segment would remain asymptomatic and act as carriers. The remaining 20% would reach hospital and only 2.5% would need ventilator support. Based on the projections of these experts, the State was staring at 6,000 casualties. He clarified that these were only projections and not a peer-reviewed research. “This is only to help us prepare for all eventualities,” he said. He criticised the Union government for the delay in expanding the testing facilities. “We should have been far more pro-active. We should have increased testing right from the beginning, instead of depending on the government centres alone. Now we have 220 testing centres; even these are not enough. We are running at least two months behind schedule,” he said. Mr. Sharma said the Rajasthan government’s decision to suspend the use of rapid testing kits was vindicated by the announcement of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday. He accused the BJP of politicising the issue. Rajasthan had conducted the highest number of tests in India and it would soon be able to screen 10,000 persons a day, he said."

The troops, onboard a truck of the force, had reached Bhilai town in the central Indian state on Saturday after staying at a police line in Agra for 20 days.“As per information, the cook of the local police in the Agra camp has been found positive for COVID-19 infection,” the official said. All the 14 personnel were tested upon their arrival and subsequently two of them sent to an isolation facility in Durg district, while the rest quarantined at a centre of the Bhilai Steel Plant, he said. Officials said the police cook could have passed on the infection to the BSF troops, who are deployed in the anti-Naxal operations grid of Chhattisgarh. They also raised concerns over the movement of the troops during the lockdown period and said all such activities have been strictly banned by the force headquarters. Such isolated instances may lead to serious consequences in the paramilitary, they said. BSF Director General (DG) S.S. Deswal had recently issued a stern warning to his commanders and personnel, saying strict action will be taken if any of them violates the COVID-19 medical protocols."

In a letter, Mr. Baghel said that taking care of the economic and mental condition of these workers and their homecoming was important.He said the Centre’s decision to impose the lockdown helped to control the spread of COVID-19 in the State.Mr. Baghel said Chhattisgarh was coordinating the return of the migrants with the other States and a plan was chalked out to bring them back by buses. However, it would be difficult to arrange for buses to transport such a large number of workers.“In the present situation, point-to-point special trains could be run to ensure the safety, convenience and hygiene of these workers. The Chhattisgarh government has made the request to Union Home Minister Amit Shah. I request you to take a quick decision on operating a special train...,” he said."

A large number of people queued up outside liquor outlets in the State capital Raipur and other districts, defying the physical distancing norms.Also read | Social distancing goes for a toss as hundreds queue up at wine shops in Visakhapatnam“The State government has given permission for online sale of liquor so that crowding at wine shops can be discouraged,” the official said. People can book orders directly through the CSMCL website or its mobile app available on the Play Store. However, the home delivery facility will not be available in Raipur and Korba districts which are not classified as green zones, the official said. The Centre has classified districts as red, orange and green zones based on the COVID-19 risk profiling. People will have to register their mobile number, Aadhaar number and address for placing the order online which will be confirmed through an OTP (one time password). A customer can order up to 5,000 ml of liquor at a time for home delivery, the official said, adding that the delivery charge is ₹120. The main opposition BJP termed the State government’s decision of home delivery of liquor as “shameful” and demanded that it be withdrawn.“The Congress, which came to power, after promising to ban liquor is now delivering liquor at home. It is a very shameful decision,” Leader of Opposition in the State Assembly Dharamlal Kaushik said."
210,Chhattisgarh,"May 09, 2020 21:35 IST",Other States,New Delhi,"Coronavirus lockdown | States should decide on exit plan, says Baghel","The States should have the power to decide on the strategy to come out of the lockdown, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel said in a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. He has argued against the centralisation of the fight against COVID-19, saying the States should have been empowered to demarcate containment zones and decide on which economic activities to start and how. In his May 8 letter, Mr. Baghel highlighted the practical difficulties in the demarcation of red zones by the Union government. Once the Centre announced the demarcation of zones based on the number of cases, what if fresh cases were detected in a green zone which had already been opened up for basic economic activities. “If a zone which had been opened up is again declared a red zone, whatever little economic activities that had restarted here will have to be shut down again. If an area that has been opened up after a long wait has to be closed down once again, we will only create a situation of unrest and uncertainty,” he said. He said the country was going through a phase of uncertainty with no clear strategy to exit the lockdown, which is due to end on May 18. “To end all these uncertainties, it is essential that while observing all necessary precautions we slowly unroll our usual economic activities. And it would only be appropriate that the State governments are given the full rights to operate the economic activities,” he wrote. On Saturday, India completed 49 days of lockdown, which started on March 25, and has been extended twice. He also reiterated the need for the Centre to give the States financial assistance. He had asked for a ₹30,000-crore package over the next three months. “To bring the State’s economy back on track, it is essential that the Centre immediately provide ₹10,000 crore..., so that the State government can extend financial help to industries, businessmen, workers and farmers, and for other sectors,” he said. He also warned that if the Centre did not step in immediately, it would be difficult for the State governments to carry on even the day-to-day operations."

Not only are they battling stigma and scorching heat, they have hardly been able to rest. Locals chased them away, they told The Hindu, accusing them of being spreading COVID-19. In the first 100 km from Jagatsinghpur, police personnel did not allow them to linger in their jurisdictions.“The police have intercepted us seven times since we started our journey. They were not ready to take the responsibility for a group of 42 people. The best they could do was to make us leave their area immediately,” said Debdas Patre, who hails from Bilaspur, here on Tuesday.

When not allowed to rest for even an hour, setting up a stove for preparing food was ruled out. As the group moved along, a kind-hearted man they came across bought them a stock of biscuits, which later proved to be their only source of sustenance.Members of the group said they had initially approached the Jagatsinghpur District Collector’s office, where they were asked to produce an official letter from the Chhattisgarh government for making arrangements for their transport. As they are not in possession of such papers, they were asked to walk away.‘Hopeless situation’“Our own Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel has also left us in the middle of a hopeless situation. We completed the registration for returning home but nobody told us how we would get there,” Ms. Kumari said. They could not afford to stay on as they have not been paid wages for two months. They have been walking with little knowledge about the journey to Chhattisgarh. “We were told to take a right turn from Khurda towards Nayagarh,” Mr. Patre said as the group crossed Bhubaneswar city. The Hindu met the group in front of city’s Khandagiri Police Station, but no effort was made to comply with the Central government’s advisory to stop people from walking.Nayagarh district may offer them respite. They may find stretches of forest where they can cook, eat and take rest before they continue onward without being hounded."

In north, east and south Delhi, the police had to resort to crowd-controlling measures to manage the crowd. By the afternoon, most of the shops were told to shut as the situation grew out of control.“Liquor shops in Delhi will remain shut till vendors make arrangements such as deployment of marshals and markings on ground to ensure social distancing. All beat staff have been instructed to be vigilant and not allow any shop to operate if the vendor does not follow safety protocols,” said a senior police officer.With only a select number of vends open, those looking to buy alcohol had to first find a shop that was open and then join a serpentine queue. “I have visited four wine shops in the area but they are all closed. I have been walking from one shop to the other only to find shuttered stores. I came early hoping to avoid the rush but it looks like there are none open near my neighbourhood,” said Vivek, a resident of Jangpura.In areas where the vends were open, residents complained about the chaos.In C-Bock Market of Vasant Vihar, long queues outside a liquor shop prompted the Vasant Vihar Welfare Association to alert authorities about the situation. Chaos was also seen outside liquor shops in Malviya Nagar and Vasant Kunj with people queuing up as early as 7 a.m. to buy alcohol.Health Minister Satyendar Jain said that the Delhi government did not give any extra relaxation and the liquor vends were opened as per central government guidelines. The Excise Department said that 160 out of 800 liquor shops were permitted to open.The four government corporations that own these vends are supposed to deploy marshals and ensure that no more than five people are allowed inside a vend at any given time, read an order issued by Chief Secretary Vijay Dev on Sunday. “The onus for opening any shop and fulfilling qualifying criteria under Clause-7 (ii) (d) of the MHA’s Order dated 01.05.2020 shall be on the corporation concerned,” it further added.Ravi Dhawan, Commissioner of the Department of Excise, Entertainment & Luxury Tax, did not respond to multiple phone calls and messages seeking comment.A report prepared by Delhi Police on the situation suggested that shop timings should be extended and there should be sufficient stock of liquor.

It was the neighbourhood kirana store that people were flocking to purchase bread and other fresh products. Three shops of a popular grocery chain said that on Monday, customers had bought in bulk and they had not yet replenished the stock. Two of them were operating with their shutters half open as they did not want people to come in and see the empty shelves.J.P. Gupta, who runs “Morning Store” in a south Delhi colony, said that he was keeping his shop open as he did not want to disappoint his customers but had stopped hiring help to provide home delivery. “If I shut my shop, it will create panic. Since Saturday, people have bought in large quantities and several items are not in stock but we will get supply by evening. I am prepared to sit at my shop and risk catching the virus but I am providing an essential service,” Mr. Gupta said.Employees dividedFor self-owned stores, the restrictions imposed have given them the opportunity to continue business while all markets are shut. But for large grocery chains, employees are divided on whether they should expose themselves to the virus at their workplace or not.“There are several people who walk into the shop and although we have a bottle of sanitiser with a guard ensuring that they spray their hands, it is not enough. We handle so many customers and then go back home putting our families at risk. We are not getting paid more. Most of us do not have bikes of our own to reach the shop,” said a cashier who preferred anonymity. Some of his colleagues differ. Rajat, another employee said: “Like doctors are working to save lives, we are working to ensure that people get food. As long as they are sanitising their hands before entering, we should continue our job. Already we have a shortage of stock. Imagine the panic it would create if we close down.”"

A ground reality check by The Hindu at four night shelters, however, revealed many shortcomings.While food was not delivered at the night shelter next to gate number 1 of AIIMS in the afternoon, the other three complained that food was delivered late. Inhabitants and caretakers of the four shelters admitted that the food was less and every day 10 to 30 people who came to the facility had to return without food.Moreover, multiple homeless people said they were unaware of the scheme. On Tuesday evening, Mr. Kejriwal said that they have noticed that the number of people at night shelters has been increasing since the programme’s launch. “We will make arrangements for food to be distributed at more locations soon,” he added.Eight-year-old Rani Kumar from Bihar, who sleeps near a lift outside gate number 1 of AIIMS, was surviving only on biscuits on Tuesday.“I have eaten only biscuits,” she said, standing outside night shelter number 584. “Yesterday there was dal chawal, but today they did not supply food here,” said Rani, who had come with her family to Delhi for her elder brother’s treatment.Inside the shelter, Ajay Kumar, 35, and his wife, who has a kidney problem, is sharing chiwda mixed with water and sugar in a steel bowl. “They did not give us food today and even my son is eating this,” he said.Sixty-year-old Ameena Khatun from Bihar, who stays in a shack opposite Sai Mandir on Lodi Road, had to make roti and eat it with salt. “I went there [night shelter], but they said the food was finished,” she said. Earlier, people who visited the temple gave them food, but with the temple shut since last Wednesday due to the COVID-19 lockdown, there have been hardly any visitors. She said that her two grandchildren only had biscuits since morning. “Now I will go there [night shelter] at 8 p.m. and if we get subzi, then I will feed them,” she added.Several families near her shack said that they were not informed that the night shelter, which is hardly 300 metres from their settlement, was distributing food for free. “I came to know about it just now,” Ms. Khatun said.At the night shelter, Rukmini Devi, 42, who was washing utensils, said that many people went back hungry. “Everyone at the night shelter got food, but at least 15 from outside didn’t get food today. Yesterday [Monday] around 25 people came and left without eating as there was no food,” she said. At the Safdarjung Airport Flyover night shelter too people said that about 20 people returned without food. “There was no oil, masala, or spice in the curry [soya bean and potato] and it was very watery. It was like the food you give to people who are ill,” said Muskaan, 15, who stays at the night shelter.Bipin Rai, member of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board, which runs the night shelters, told The Hindu that they had just launched the initiative and would take days to iron out all the glitches. “We have just started delivering food and it is the third day. We are also figuring out how much food is needed and we are increasing the quantity so that nobody goes without food.”"

We all cooked and shared,” said Bablu, 48. He claimed that many of them have not had food for even longer. “The work stopped around five days before the people’s curfew.

They urged for immediate closure of meats markets and shops which do not follow food safety guidelines.The organisations, which include People for Animals (PFA) said, “The rise of antimicrobial resistance, along with the emergence of new, highly pathogenic viral strains, have been linked to live animal markets, including pet and wildlife trade and meat production systems”.“Live animal markets and facilities that confine animals in crowded conditions are fertile hotbeds of zoonotic pathogens,” Gauri Maulekhi of the PFA said adding, “The meat, fish and egg industry in India confines millions of animals in crowded facilities, transports them in similar conditions, and slaughters them in the most unhygienic manner”.“Despite a clear distinction for operation of such businesses made out in law, meat markets also double as meat shops. Slaughtering animals in markets, in shops where other live animals are confined in close quarters, is a common sight,” the joint letter to the Union Health Minister said.Apart from the PFA, Humane Society International/India, Mercy for Animals India Foundation, Federation of Indian Animal Protection Organisations, and Ahimsa Trust, have collectively appealed to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare to work with the Ministry of Animal Husbandry, Dairying and Fisheries to regulate intensive animal agriculture.Public health crisisThey also called for closure of meat markets and shops which do not follow the Food Safety and Standard Authority of India guidelines. Claiming that “often, the meat of diseased and infected animals enter the food market and is invariably consumed by the public,” the animal protection groups said, “Allowing the meat industry to flourish in such uncertain times of public health crisis will have widespread and debilitating ramifications upon public health and safety”.The letter also called highlighted that no standards are notified for the trait selection, housing and rearing of poultry or swine rearing. “The absence of regulations relating to livestock production lead to intensive, crowded rearing, unnatural diets, antibiotic abuse and various other practices that have lead us into the COVID-19 crisis,” it added.They also said that a majority of pet shops across the country which operate through live animal markets are largely unregulated and illegal as well. Despite the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act (Pet Shop) Rules of 2018, now being in force for nearly two years, barely any of these shops are registered with the State animal welfare boards as is a requisite under the rules, they said."

The authorities, meanwhile, stated that they have increased the amount of food being served at these shelters. Though the food sufficed for those in the three-night shelters, The Hindu visited, people and caretakers complained that more food is needed to serve homeless people who come to the shelter for just food. On Saturday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that due to the pandemic, the government-run night shelters are open for all and would provide food for anyone. “Yesterday [Wednesday] night, on Lodi Road, dal chawal was distributed at 11.30 p.m. I slept off by then and in the morning, we couldn’t eat it and had to throw it away,” said 55-year-old Jameela Khatun. “I beg at the mandir, but now that is also closed due to the disease. What will we do,” she asked. The delay, a caretaker said, was due to miscommunication. “The food was mistakenly dropped off at AIIMS last night and then we had to get it from there and that caused the delay,” he said. Though the food was inadequate for all those who came from outside, the quantity have increased, he said. Food portion“Everyday we are increasing the number of meals we are serving. Today, we gave lunch to more than 20,000 people in our night shelters,” Bipin Rai, a member of the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB), which runs the night shelters, said. “Also the Chief Minister has said that we will start ward-level distribution of food to more than one lakh people everyday and the DUSIB will be part of this programme too,” he added. On Thursday afternoon, hundreds of people lined up for free lunch at a night shelter in Yamuna Pushta in east Delhi. But people sat close to each other and some complained that the portion of food being served was less. “The quantity is so less that even a child’s stomach would not be filled with this,” said a person in his forties.Shoaib Khureshi, from Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh, who has been staying at a night shelter outside AIIMS for the last 15 days, had another grouse. “Khichdi was less yesterday [Wednesday]. Today it was more.” A caretaker admitted that the food would never suffice as more people are flocking the tents during the curbs. “There are 11 tents [shelters] around AIIMS and food is never going to be enough, as a lot of people come from outside. But we served almost everyone that came to our tent for lunch. We have been getting more food for the last two days,” he said.Near a night shelter in INA, a father of five children from Sitapur said he could not sell bamboo furniture for the last five days, and hence has to depend on food from the night shelters. “The government should give food to everyone who lives in slums. What else will we do? Police don’t allow us to go out and sell our things,” he said."

Besides, the milk business of the villagers has also taken a hit adding to their financial woes.Nanak Yadav (41), a resident of Hazipur village on Sohna-Palwal road, said a large number of labourers from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh would throng the villages in the region during the harvest season towards the end of March, but there was none this time around due to shutdown. The combine harvesters would reach the villages, mostly from Punjab, but that too was not allowed. Mr. Yadav, who owns three acres of agricultural land, said he would begin harvesting his wheat crop in two-acre land in the second week of April and then the mustard. “Though the family members, along with the local labourers would delay the harvest of the crops, the bigger challenge for the farmers would be to keep it stored till the procurement begins,” said Mr. Yadav.Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar has announced that the procurement for mustard and wheat would commence on April 15 and 20 respectively, if the situation allowed.Raj, a Nimoth resident, said the delayed procurement also meant delayed payment and it would add to their financial woes. He said though the government may not press for payment of loan under the Kisan Credit Cards, they need to repay the money taken from private lenders.Ravinder Kumar of Kherili Lala said that most of his fellow villagers ran dairies and supplied milk to Gurugram and Faridabad, but the business was adversely hit due to the shutdown. He said that around 1,500 litres of milk was supplied from his village daily, but now many had stopped the supply. “After a case of COVID-19 in Faridabad, we held a Panchayat, pleading all villagers to stop the supply. But many did not agree, citing financial reasons. It has now led to fear among the residents that these people could be carriers of COVID-19 to the village, infecting all,” said Mr. Kumar. He, however, said that the villagers had discontinued the practice of playing cards and smoking hookahs sitting in huddles after a police team visited the village two days back to sensitise them and following a similar appeal from the Sarpanch.Mr. Kumar, who runs a real estate business, said the lockdown had hit him hard since many of his clients had not made the payment.Om Prakash Chopra, a resident of Gamroj village off the Gurugram-Alwar Highway, said the police did not allow the opening of all grocery shops in his village and threatened the shopkeepers to pull down their shutters. He also accused the police of high-handedness, saying that he was stopped and abused while he was going to a doctor to get his daughter-in-law examined."

Around March 12-13, people from across the nations gathered for a religious congregation. Many of them left for their homes but many stayed back. We are now bringing out the people who have stayed back and tests are being conducted now, out of which 24 cases have come out to be positive,” Mr. Kejriwal said.He added: “In the last three days, 1,548 people have been brought out of the centre, 441 have been moved to hospitals and 1,447 to quarantine facilities.”The Chief Minister said the world was affected by the disease with even developed nations under its ambit. Thousands of peoplehad lost their lives in the U.S., Spain, Italy, China and many more, he added.If religious congregations of different faiths continued, it was going to be “a huge problem”, he said, terming the congregation at Nizamuddin “a serious act” and requesting religious leaders across different faiths to ensure that no gatherings are encouraged.“Navratri has been going on but we have seen no crowd on the streets and in the temples. Gurudwaras have been shut, people are not going to masjids, Mecca is empty, Vatican City is empty,” Mr. Kejriwal said.“Many people have gone back to other cities after attending this event. I hope not but think about the people that have been already affected by this. With folded hands, I request all the religious leaders and people to cooperate with the government,” he added. The government had written to the L-G for filing an FIR against the mosque administration, he said, adding: “Several reports of how the officials did not act on time are also coming up. If the involvement of any official is found out, strict action will be taken against them. Lives of many people present in the centre have been put at risk; six persons died after attending the event and reaching Telangana,” he added."

All of them, however, at home, without work and without money. “The employers said that they would not give money and we don’t know when this lockdown will end. My brother is a rickshaw-puller and my father ran a small business which has been shut now. We are left with little money which will not last long. That is why we thought of applying for ration,” she said.“Socha tha sarkar se thodi madad ho jaegi lekin vo bhi nahin ho rahi [We thought that the government would help us a bit, but that is not happening]”.Gulfam Mustafa, who hails from Bihar and resides in Noor-e-ilahi, used to sew cloth material for a living.

By 2.30 p.m., nearly 300 people had registered and allegedly about 40-odd were called inside to submit documents.

Citing Italy’s example in this regard, the Chief Minister stressed on the need for strict implementation of the lockdown even as he urged landlords to relax payment deadlines for tenants and appealed to people to help each other and try to ensure no one around them was forced to sleep hungry.“The Delhi government has ordered a lockdown in Delhi from 6 a.m. today [Monday] till March 31 midnight, keeping in mind the outbreak of COVID-19.

The situation of first-world countries, like Italy and America is also alarming. We are fortunate that we got enough time to prepare in advance...The situation in Delhi is under control, but this is not the time to congratulate ourselves but follow the restrictions because if we do not take action today and the disease spreads to a large number of people then it is going to be tough,” he said.From Tuesday, he said, if anybody was found violating the lockdown orders, the government would be forced to take strict action. The restrictions put in place, however, were causing a financial burden on the poor and daily-wage labourers and steps had been taken to alleviate the same, he said. These, Mr. Kejriwal said, included the provision of 7.5 kg free ration to 72 lakh beneficiaries for one month and doubling pension under the widow pension scheme for 2.5 lakh beneficiaries, the old-age pension scheme for 5 lakh beneficiaries and the disability pension scheme for 1 lakh beneficiaries.“The beneficiaries will get the pension amount for March and April, by April 7.

On Sunday night, a 26-year-old MPhil Scholar from the University of Delhi, was allegedly spat on by a man on his scooty, who called her “Coronavirus” before fleeing in a “dark alley” near Baccha Park in Mukherjee Nagar area. The woman, from Manipur, said that she and her friend were returning to their paying guest accommodation after buying vegetables when the incident happened.“One man, aged around 50 years, slowed down his scooty and spat paan on my face and called us ‘Coronavirus’ and drove away,” she said. As soon they reached their accommodation, they called the police and lodged a complaint. “This is not the only incident we have faced. We have been called names and now they are spitting on us. We are not the ones who brought the virus to Delhi. We came here to study and with a hope of a better future. We are also Indians. Why should we be discriminated in our own land?” she asked.The police have registered a First Information Report. Deputy Commissioner of Police (North West) Vijyanta Arya said that a case under section 509 (word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman) of the IPC has been registered and CCTV footage is being scanned to identify the man on scooty. Online abuseIn another incident, a 28-year-old political activist, Angellica Aribam from Manipur, was racially attacked online. She has lodged a complaint with Delhi Police Cyber Cell and the Northeast Cell Nodal Officer via email. Ms. Aribam told The Hindu that she had urged a Minister to take steps regarding COVID-19 on Twitter, after which she was hurled with racial slurs, besides copping threats on Facebook.“The trolling turned racist and a graphic image was posted by a user. That’s when I decided that I’ll not take this. I also called the Northeast helpline and they offered to send a police official but I thought it wasn’t required,” she said.Subsequently, she wrote to Delhi Police, and on Monday afternoon received a call from Cyber Crime Unit, who promised legal action. Ms. Aribam said that people from the Northeast have been facing racism regularly. “The reason is that we don’t have an anti-racism or discrimination law. People think they can comment and get away with it. No leader talks about it. There is a lack of political will,” she said.General Secretary of Manipur Students Association Thokchom Veewon said that because of COVID-19 outbreak, a lot of students have left for their hometown. “Because of the features of the people from Northeast, they are being ridiculed as ‘Coronavirus’. They are being teased by calling “corona” at sight, treated differently at shops, convenience stores, etc. for which videos have been shared on social media. This is a total act of blatant ignorance and racial discrimination,” he said. He also said that a lot of students have shared similar experiences.  Dr. Alana Golmei, General Secretary of Northeast Support Centre, said she was racially attacked and called ‘Coronavirus’ when she was roaming with a friend recently."

This decision, taken without proper planning, completely overlooked the disastrous impact it would have on 90 percent of our labour force.

Many of them are stranded and starving in the industrial belts where they work. In the absence of any transport, many are walking hundreds of kilometres to their villages on a hungry stomach. Others, in desperation, are packing themselves in lorries, at the risk of contracting or spreading the virus.We make this urgent plea to the Central Government to pay heed to the situation immediately. The government must use the network of anganwadis, panchayat bhavans, government schools, government colleges, railway stations, bus stations, community halls, block offices, district headquarters etc to set up feeding centres to arrange free cooked food, medical care and sanitation. Foodgrains to the tune of 585 lakh metric tonnes are available in godowns of the Food Corporation of India (FCI) and Central Warehousing Corporation (even before the wheat harvest). Some of it can be used to prepare cooked meals and/or take-home rations in these centres. This assistance should be available to all unconditionally, without any paperwork. This will still leave more than enough food in the godowns to fulfil the Finance Minister’s announcements and maintain adequate buffer stocks.We also urge the government to immediately arrange for sanitised bus and train services to enable stranded workers to reach home safely.

Mr. Gautam, who is the Minister of Social Welfare, said, “The Delhi government has ensured that each one of you has an adequate supply of food. We have arranged for food and other necessities in our night shelters as well as various government schools. There is no need to worry. My appeal to the people walking back to their villages is to return to their homes in Delhi.”Health concernRequesting everyone to stay indoors, Mr. Gautam added, “The purpose of the lockdown is to stop transmission of this virus. We are extremely concerned about the health of the citizens and it is my appeal to everyone to not put their lives on risk.”“Several of these migrants are daily wage labourers and amid the lockdown, their livelihood has been adversely affected. The Kejriwal government has ensured that nobody will sleep hungry in Delhi and for that arrangements have been made,” Mr. Gautam said."

Our capacity for providing food to 4 lakh people across the city is ready. Today, arrangements have been made in 568 schools for the city, and food is also being served in 238 night shelters. Around 800-825 total food shelters have been created in Delhi,” he said.“The Delhi government’s flying squads are also distributing food items to the needy across the city.

I want to appeal to them again that the Delhi government has made all arrangements for you and we are trying our best to help you,” he said.‘Necessary lockdown’“I also want to say that the decision to implement a nationwide lockdown announced by the Prime Minister is absolutely necessary. If we do not abide by the lockdown, we are exposing our nation to the risk of the COVID-19 outbreak as we have observed in other nations. Migrating in huge groups will also expose us to the risk of COVID-19. Please stay wherever you are,” said Mr. Kejriwal."

Even if I take one minute to clear an application, it will take me a week to dispose off them all,” said Mr. Dhaka, adding that only 2,800 applications have been processed so far out of which 1,586 — mostly associated with essential services — were allowed.Mr. Dhaka has appealed to residents to seek a pass only in unavoidable circumstances. “A pass must be sought in case of a prior appointment with the doctor, but in case of medical exigency, such as heart attack, it can be avoided,” he added.The suppliers of essential services also need passes. Individuals are being one-day passes while organisations are being given passes that are valid for seven days, Mr. Dhaka said.Besides two computer operators, the representatives of the District Food and Supply Controller office and Industry are also part of the team to grant the passes. “The DFSC and Industry representatives help us verify the claims of essential services suppliers,” said Mr. Dhaka."

More than 400 people with symptoms were admitted to different hospitals and over 1,100 shifted to government-run quarantine facilities in Delhi alone over March 30 and 31, officials said.Hundreds of others who returned home after staying at the centre over the last fortnight might have carried the virus to several States, authorities fear.Coronavirus | Nizamuddin centre COVID-19 cases spark a controversyThousands of people from across the country, as well as from Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Saudi Arabia, attended a gathering at the centre earlier this month over a number of days, officials said.A large number of them were stuck on the premises as the country went under lockdown on March 24. Markaz Nizamuddin is the international headquarters of Tablighi Jamaat, a puritanical Islamic sect.The Delhi police on Tuesday registered a case against Maulana Saad and others of Tablighi Jamaat under Section 3 of the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, read with Sections 269, 270, 271 and 120-B of the IPC, for violation of government directions in respect of restriction of gatherings and safety measures, including physical-distancing.Coronavirus | Helpline numbers | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in IndiaThe centre said in a statement that many participants could not disperse after all means of transport came to an abrupt halt on March 24, though it tried to make special arrangements with permission from the authorities. “Under such compelling circumstances, there was no option for Markaz Nizamuddin but to accommodate the stranded visitors with prescribed medical precautions till the situation becomes conducive to their movement or arrangements are made by the authorities,” the statement said.Close community interactions in prayer, dining and travel among Tablighi Jamaat followers put them at a high risk of the contagion. Participants at the recent congregation included people from Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Jammu and Kashmir and Kerala — in cases already known.One attendee, a Srinagar-based businessman, died of the disease on March 26.

The labourers said they did not have enough money and food to sustain their families and arrangements be made to send them back. The police were called in and the situation was brought under control without the use of force.Former Suncity RWA president Abhey Poonia said the construction activity inside the township had come to a halt following the lockdown and the labourers did not have enough to sustain themselves. He also alleged the shopkeepers inside the township were selling groceries and essential commodities to the labourers at a higher price forcing them to protest. RWA’s vice-president Prashant Kumar said around 150 forms were filled with the help of the district administration in the evening to facilitate the labourers’ return back. Local resident Sonal Pathak, a social worker, said the workers had little support from the builders and the residents were collecting funds among themselves to supply ration and other food items, such as biscuits, to the workers. She said the workers felt trapped since it was a containment zone and the market inside was not meant for them.Station House Officer, Sector 53, Deepak said that labourers wanted to return to their homes, but the police officers spoke to them and brought the situation under control.  A large number of workers in Manesar’s Kho had on Sunday thronged the village streets creating a stampede-like situation during the registration to send them back homes."

294,Delhi,"May 03, 2020 23:37 IST",Delhi,New Delhi,"After new lockdown rules, RWAs against allowing helps","Most of the Resident Welfare Associations (RWAs) in the city have decided not to allow domestic helps to enter their neighbourhoods after relaxation of the lockdown, said an association representative on Sunday. Under directions issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs, the RWAs had been asked to take a call on whether domestic helps would be allowed in their localities following relaxation of the lockdown on Monday.Containment certaintySharat Jha, president of the Apartment Owners Association (AOA) in Sangam Vihar said, “Till there was 100% certainty about the containment of the virus, we won’t allow.” Mr. Jha, and many others argued that with a large number of asymptomatic cases, there was no way of ascertaining who was carrying the virus and who was not. He informed that only certain e-commerce services, from verified companies undertaking safety precautions would be allowed. While not everyone in his locality was convinced about following these rules, Mr. Jha said that the few who opposed the decision would have to agree.B.S. Vohra of the East Delhi RWA association hit out at the government. He said that the move was an attempt to “shift responsibility [for the spread of the virus] towards the RWAs”. ‘How will we check who has the virus,” he asked, highlighting that the RWAs had not been supplied with thermal guns, sanitisers or PPE kits by local authorities. “RWAs are never consulted on any matter,” he complained. While such groups have been urging for empowerment, they have always been neglected in decision-making, he said. “We have sent an advisory in our groups,” he said, but how far would it be followed by individual home owners was another question.Rajiv Kakria, convener of the ‘Save our City’ campaign, an association for RWAs and NGO, argued that such a decision must not be shifted on to the RWAs. He said that the government should take a call to disallow services such as domestic helps which involved going to multiple houses in a day and interacting with a large number of people. Mr. Kakria expressed concern that the gains in “flattening the curve” which had been made in the last few weeks of lockdown may go to waste. Stressing on the difficulties of enforcing such a rule, he pointed out that there were several households that were already asking maids to visit their houses, some with “genuine reasons”. However, with the relaxations extended, “once the floodgates open.. hundreds of maids will come”, despite the restrictions, he warned."

301,Delhi,"April 06, 2020 23:35 IST",Delhi,NEW DELHI,"To beat lockdown, RWAs launch campaigns urging people to stay in touch","Nearly two weeks since Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown curbing movement of people, the Resident Welfare Assocaitions across the Capital have taken several measures, including calling campaigns to stay in touch and ensuring change of clothes for house helps. People are encouraged not to step out and if they do, they are asked to go back, the RWAs said.In East Delhi, a campaign has been launched by the RWA in an attempt to ensure that people talk to each other even as they are at home. B.S. Vohra, resident of Krishna Nagar and president of East Delhi RWA Joint Front Federation, said that they have named the campaign #LockDownCallNow. “It’s Lockdown all over due to COVID-19. We can’t meet each other but can at least talk with our friends and relatives over phone. Don’t stop interacting. Pick your phone and call now,” read a WhatsApp message sent to everyone on several RWA groups here.Mental healthTalking about the campaign, Mr. Vohra said that it has been initiated to ensure people don’t feel low. “If this continues and people don’t step out and don’t interact, one can go into depression also. Therefore, taking care of mental health, we are running this campaign. I, too, call my neighbours and relatives everyday,” he said.Mr. Vohra also said that all the street vendors who come to their colony are allowed only with identity proof. “All the security guards have been asked to check the identity of those entering and also where they’re coming from,” he said.Meanwhile, a South Delhi locality’s RWA has come up with strict rules during lockdown, including house helps changing clothes once they enter a house.Senior citizensSangita Thukral, president of Chittaranjan Park’s (M&P Blocks) RWA, said that while house helps who are not permanently staying in the house are prohibited from coming in, only those who work at the residence of senior citizens are allowed and that too, on alternative days. “They have been asked to keep a change of clothes at the residence. They come, take shower, change, do the work, change again and then leave,” she said.Apart from this, Ms. Thukral said that only authorised street vendors are allowed to enter the colonies and are provided with hand sanitisers, gloves and masks in case they don’t have already. “They can come in from 8 a.m.- 11 a.m.,” she said. In addition, the main gates of the colonies are opened only between 8.15 a.m. and 10.15 a.m. for people to step out for milk and daily groceries, she said. Movement passesIn a locality in central Delhi’s Jama Masjid area, the RWA is of the opinion that movement passes should have been issued to members of the association to let them help the people in need. Mohammed Sabir, Dujana House RWA president, said, “The government and NGOs are ensuring that they are all fed. But if someone has an emergency, we are unable to help them with movement. They should have provided RWA members with movement passes.”All RWAs said that situation has “eased up” as compared to the initial days of the lockdown and while they didn’t get newspapers in the beginning, they have now started getting them delivered. Mr. Vohra said that they didn’t get the newspapers for the first three days but have been getting after that. Ms. Thukral said that they started getting papers only two days ago. Mr. Sabir, however, said that they still haven’t started getting the newspapers. “We have to depend on TV. In Jama Masjid area, people mostly bought from street vendors and they are not sitting. Those who deliver come from far off places and find it tough to move,” he said.Talking about how the situation has changed “a little bit” in the last few days, Sanjeev Baruah, resident of South Delhi Alaknanda, said that food delivery has begun now. “The delivery boys, however, are stopped at the gate and one has to go fetch the parcel,” he said. Mr. Baruah, however, shared that not having a house help is a problem for his 93-year-old mother who stays with him, however, her permanent attendant “is a great help”.In west Delhi’s Rajouri Garden, newspapers started after initial hiccups and also, vegetable vendors who were earlier not allowed to come are now being allowed, said Jatin Gandhi, an RWA member."

304,Delhi,"April 07, 2020 19:37 IST",National,India,India biggest producer of ‘game-changer’ hydroxychloroquine drug; has enough capacity,"New Delhi India is the biggest manufacturer of hydroxychloroquine, the anti-malarial drug that is being touted as ‘game-changer’ in the fight against COVID-19 and is being aggressively sought by US President Donald Trump.Also read: Hydroxychloroquine shows potential to treat COVID-19, a preprint claims The country has the capacity to quickly ramp up the output of hydroxychloroquine. Days after it added the drug to the list of more than two dozen APIs that cannot be exported while officials get a handle on how much will be needed for COVID-19 outbreak in the country, India on Tuesday agreed to lift the ban after Mr.Trump sought supplies for the US. India manufactures 70 per cent of the world’s supply of hydroxychloroquine, according to Indian Pharmaceutical Alliance (IPA) secretary-general Sudarshan Jain. The country has a production capacity of 40 tonnes of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) every month, implying 20 crore tablets of 200 mg each. And since the drug is also used to auto-immune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, manufacturers have good production capacities that can also be ramped up. Ipca Laboratories, Zydus Cadila and Wallace Pharmaceuticals are top pharma companies manufacturing HCQ in India. Jain says the production capacity is sufficient to meet the current demand and if the need arises, the companies are committed to ramping up production. Recently, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had reportedly placed an order for around 10 crore tables of HCQ with Ipca laboratories and Zydus Cadila. The drug is not manufactured in developed nations such as the US because of non-existent malaria. Hydroxychloroquine is very similar to chloroquine, one of the oldest and best-known anti-malarial drugs, but with lesser side-effects. It can be bought over the counter and fairly inexpensive. But its purchase and use has been severely restricted as it was selectively used in the treatment of coronavirus because of its antiviral properties. India gets the active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) that is used to manufacture HCQ from China and supplies so far have been steady. As much as 70 per cent of all the APIs needed by India to manufacture drugs come from China.After Mr. Trump stated that the US could “retaliate” if India does not release stocks of the drug, Indian officials said exports of hydroxychloroquine and paracetamol will be allowed depending on availability of stock after meeting domestic requirements and existing orders. Last month, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) partially lifted a three-year-old ‘import alert’ on Ipca’s two plants to import the medicine. Zydus Cadila has also received an order from the US. Pharma industry officials said the country has enough stock of HCQ and companies were ready to ramp up the capacity to meet domestic requirements as well as exports. On March 25, India had banned export of HCQ and added it to a list of more than two dozen APIs that can no longer be exported. India is the largest exporter of the drug. Officials said India would export the drug on a case-by-case basis after meeting all the domestic requirements.“The Government has withdrawn the restrictions on 12 products and its formulations. Various scenarios are being assessed and it will be the endeavour to meet both the domestic demand and export obligation for Paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine,” Jain said. The objective is to minimise speculative buying and hoarding in these trying times and ensure balance in the distribution for patients and segments who need them, he added. In a similar vein, Indian Drug Manufacturers’ Association (IDMA) Executive Director Ashok Kumar Madan said: “India needs around 24 million tablets per year as on date for the three indications — malaria, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis, it was being used“.India currently has an annual installed capacity of around 40 metric tonnes of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) of hydroxychloroquine. With this capacity, “we can make around 200 million tablets of 200 mg”, he added. So this indicates that India currently has spare available capacity. Now, “we have to see how much would the country’s requirements for the drug would grow for both treatment and prevention of COVID-19. The companies have already started ramping the capacity.” The major API makers for the drug in the country are Zydus, Ipca and Mangalam Drugs. The major formulation makers of hydroxychloroquine are Ipca, Zydus, Wallace Pharmaceuticals, and Cipla, Madan said. India exported hydroxychloroquine API in April-January 2019-20 period worth USD 1.22 billion. During the same period exports of formulations made from hydroxychloroquine were at USD 5.50 billion. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) recommended HCQ be used as a preventive medication for COVID-19 high-risk group. It has also recommended the use of the drug for those involved in the care of ‘suspected or confirmed cases of the coronavirus and for asymptomatic household contacts of laboratory-confirmed patients, apart from healthcare workers who are involved in the treatment of COVID-19’ Ipca is the drug’s top manufacturer globally. Each COVID-19 patient reportedly needs 14 tablet course and so the 10 crore pills ordered by the government can potentially treat over 71 lakh people."

306,Delhi,"April 07, 2020 23:14 IST",Delhi,NEW DELHI,COVID-19 | ‘Give free ration to all using indelible ink marker’,"Anita Tiwari is used to paying for her food with her own earnings: ₹8,000 per month from the domestic work she does in three homes, along with the ₹5,000 per month her husband earns as a security guard. However, the COVID-19 lockdown has left her struggling to feed her family.“We don’t have any ration card because our landlord is not willing to let us use that address,” says the 50-year old resident of Savitri Nagar, a low-income area in Sheikh Sarai. Her problem is common to many people renting homes in Delhi’s bastis and unauthorised colonies, resulting in lakhs of people deprived of a ration card. “One of my employers says she will pay me half month’s rent, but I can’t even go and get it because of this lockdown. The others won’t pay because I’m not working. How will we eat?”On Tuesday, right to food activists wrote to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to reiterate their demand that provide free rations for all, telling him that the Delhi government’s system to provide food for those without ration cards are too “unwieldy and impractical” for many like Ms. Tiwari.Complicated process“The system requires those without ration cards to apply for an e-coupon using a website to register themselves for accessing rations. They need to have the ability to access the Internet, have a mobile phone to generate an OTP, upload a photo of their Aadhaar card and a photo of their family, and finally, download the e-coupon. At a time when mobility is restricted, it cannot be assumed that everyone will manage to reach civil society or government volunteers who can help them fill the forms,” said the letter, signed by activists of the Delhi Rozi Roti Adhikar Abhiyan. They added that another complication is that foodgrain for those without ration cards are being distributed at government schools rather than the Fair Price Shops which are better equipped to do it. They asked the government to instead give free rations to everyone who demands it, using a simple mechanism such as marking a designated nail with indelible ink, as in elections, to ensure that people do not take rations multiple times from different shops. “In the current emergency situation, an elaborate system which people would find difficult even during ordinary times, will make rations inaccessible to the poorest and most marginalised who need it the most,” they said.Call for transparencyIn an earlier letter, the activists also demanded better transparency and accountability from the Public Distribution System (PDS), noting that almost a third of ration shops checked in the first week of April were shut, with several claiming they do not have stock.Parmila, a mother of four who lives in Motilal Nehru Camp, a basti near Munirka, has been turned away from her ration shop several times this week. “I have recieved the wheat ration promised by the Delhi government, but the shopkeeper says he has not yet recieved my rice or sugar ration,” she says.However, an online search shows that rice and sugar due to her were delivered at the ration shop on March 23 and 24. She has also not received the extra free ration promised by the Centre. “Since my husband is a daily wage labourer and I am a domestic worker, neither of us have received wages since the bandh. Without the extra ration, the family will go hungry,” she says.Reena and Sunil Kumar, who live in Mongolpuri, have not even got their wheat ration for the month. “The shopkeeper claims the rice ration has not yet arrived at the shop, so he will wait and give us both together,” says Mr. Kumar, noting that his wife has been to the shop every day for the past five days. Again, the online record shows that all the grains due to the family have been delivered to the shop.According to a Delhi government order dated March 26, ration stock for two months was to be delivered to all shops by March 29. Government data shows ration has been distributed to only 60% of cardholders even while many shops are claiming they have run out of stock. “This raises serious concerns about the possibility of diversion of grains,” said the letter to the CM from the activists, demanding full information disclosure and a robust grievance redressal mechanism to ensure that people are not cheated out of their ration allocation during this emergency."
307,Delhi,"April 07, 2020 23:10 IST",Delhi,New Delhi,COVID-19 | Nizamuddin residents fight ‘virus hotspot’ tag,"On an ordinary day, the ‘langar’ (communal kitchen) at Delhi’s Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah would produce food for about 5,000 needy people who throng the shrine of Khwaja Nizamuddin Aulia.The area has been in lockdown since March 24, but under especially strict surveillance by police and paramilitary personnel since the outbreak of COVID-19 was detected at the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz (centre) not far from the area.Tainted by one buildingNow, says Syed Aziz Nizami, whose family has been the caretakers of the shrine for hundreds of years, the kitchen can only cater to about 100-200 people a day, and volunteers deliver the food outside of the area, as no one is allowed in. More than anything, says Mr. Nizami, he is saddened by how the entire area, named after the famous 13th century Sufi saint, has been “tainted” by one building, belonging to the Tablighi Jamaat, as a “COVID-19 hotspot”.“Badnamgi toh hui hai [Our name has been spoilt],” he says, explaining that he himself had never been inside in the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, a lesser-known Islamic organisation espousing rigorous religious practices. “We had no idea there were so many people, so many foreigners inside. The dargah’s door is open to all faiths, unlike theirs,” he adds.Significantly, despite the entire Nizamuddin area being referred to as a “hotspot”, cases of the novel COVID-19 have only come from the Tablighi Jamaat building, where hundreds of foreign nationals from Indonesia, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Thailand attended a conference in mid-March, leading to the largest spike in confirmed cases in the country. Over the last week, health and municipal workers have conducted door-to-door sanitation programmes, and testing of the residents in about 2,000 homes surrounding the building, but “no case of COVID-19 has been reported in the immediate neighbourhood of the centre”, an official told The Hindu.‘Blind panic’Area municipal councillor Yasmeen Kidwai says that the coverage of the case in the media, and a lack of officially verified information has spread “blind panic” amongst residents. “I wish there had been protocols followed to calm people’s unfounded fears that the whole area has been contaminated,” she told The Hindu, calling for a report on best practices to be followed at “COVID-19 hotspots” to be adopted by the government.The area’s reputation has hurt in more ways, say residents. It is hard to access vegetables and regular supplies as many vendors stay away. Noor Jehan, 28, says she goes out of the house only once every three days, to try and find provisions for her family that includes her two-year old son and seven-year old daughter. As the manager for a ladies cooperative kebab delivery outlet called ‘Zaika e Nizamuddin’, Ms. Jehan says she has been doubly hit during the lockdown. Despite the government permitting food outlets to run deliveries, the 11 women who run the cooperative felt it would be safer to shut down operations until restrictions are lifted, and have lost out on a steady source of income as a result.In fact, they could have done brisk business, given that delivery companies like Swiggy and Zomato have suspended all operations to the Nizamuddin area, including the crowded Nizamuddin Basti where the Tablighi Manzil is, and the more upmarket Nizamuddin East and Nizamuddin West colonies nearby.Hospital refused to helpWhat’s worse is that two days ago, says the local Residents’ Welfare Association (RWA), a renowned Delhi hospital nearby even refused to send an ambulance when an aged, diabetic resident of the area, whose sugar levels had dropped, needed to be rushed to the hospital. Another hospital sent an ambulance in the nick of time, says president of the Nizamuddin East Colony Association Rajive Chaudhury. “Fear is bringing out the worst in so many people,” he told The Hindu. “It seems it isn’t just a battle against the disease, but pitting people against each other.”(The writer is a resident of Nizamuddin)"
308,Delhi,"April 07, 2020 22:45 IST",Delhi,NEW DELHI,Meals made by Tihar inmates feed the hungry,"On Tuesday afternoon at a government school in New Delhi, residents of JJ cluster in Khyala’s Raghubir Nagar stood in two separate queues waiting for meals. While this could have been mistaken for a common scene during the COVID-19 lockdown, what stood out was that the food was prepared by Tihar jail prisonersStarting a couple of days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown, meals prepared by Tihar inmates was distributed within a 5 km radius of the jail based on requirements, said a senior officer at Tihar jail. At the school, head warden Yogender Kumar with his team and 10 Civil Defence officials ensured that the residents maintained a safe distance from each other and received dal, chapatis, and rice. Interestingly, the meals to be distributed are essentially leftovers after the inmates are served at the jail. “On most days, food for at least 40-50 people are left over after every meal. Therefore, it was decided that we must send this food for those who need it, especially the ones dependent on daily wages. Therefore, the food that is left from nine prisons in the Tihar jail premises is collected and sent,” the prison official said.Lunch is served inside the prison at 11 a.m., and so by 11.45 a.m., the officials get an idea of how much will be surplus. Mr. Kumar then starts collecting from each prison and finally leaves for the various venues by 12.30 p.m. for lunch and by 6.30 p.m. for dinner — with food for about 500 people.The head warden said the food is taken to places where the Delhi government has set up relief centres. Government officials share the requirement with Mr. Kumar, who is tasked with the transport of food from Tihar jail.The official said when a superintendent-rank officer of one of the jails shared the idea of food distribution with the inmates, one had said, “Sir, we will eat one chapati less, if required.”At the JJ cluster, people were unaware that the food was prepared by Tihar inmates. A 28-year-old woman, Devi, said, “It doesn’t matter who is cooking as long as we are getting food.” However, as Devi went an hour after the distribution began, she had to return empty-handed. Meanwhile, many others said the food tasted “okay”.School principal R.B. Singh said people queued up at 8 a.m. on Tuesday in the hope of getting dry rations. However, these people were later informed that there was no such facility. “People kept a bag or one of their belongings to mark their place in the queue even if they don’t stand,” Mr. Singh said.A resident, Manoj Kumar, complained that they were told about the free ration beforehand. “We stood in queues to get the free ration. We also , which got the “Why wouldn’t we stand? We were told that we’ll start getting free ration on April 7. We also tried to apply online but the website’s server is down,” he said."

This is completely wrong information. We will ensure that every mohalla clinic will be fully functional during this tough time.” Thousands of people, mainly from lower-middle income groups, rely on the clinics for medical care every day. “On Tuesday, about 300 mohalla clinics were open. On Monday, the number was less,” a Delhi government official told The Hindu. In the last week of March, the Delhi government had directed heads of all hospitals and institutions under the Department of Health and Family Welfare to hire private vehicles for officials to reach their place of duty as many were “unable to do so due to the lockdown”. But this facility is not available for mohalla clinic staff as they are not permanent employees, said officials. “Initially the staff were finding it difficult to reach the clinics as they did not have ID cards. Now, they have been issued special ID cards so that they can reach the clinics,” the official said. The staff needs to be dependent on DTC buses or their own vehicles to reach the clinic “but not everyone is able to do so”, the official added.Clinics see footfallThe clinics, which were open, saw a footfall of 100-150 on an average. But more mohalla clinics are open compared to the last week of March, when about 250 clinics were shut."

Of the 3.07 lakh calls received by the ‘CHILDLINE 1098’ helpline for children in distress across the country between March 20-31, covering the first week of the lockdown, 30% were about protection against abuse and violence on children, said Harleen Walia, deputy director of Childline India.

Also read | Closure of schools due to COVID-19 may lead to online child sexual abuse, warns IJMAccording to Walia, the number of calls after the lockdown, which started after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s speech on March 24, has increased by 50%.

Discussions at the workshop focused on coronavirus-related issues and ways to reduce stress on children during the ongoing lockdown. Some of the other calls received following the lockdown dealt with physical health (11% of calls), child labour (8%), missing and run away children (8%) and homeless (5%), according to figures shared by Walia in the meeting. Besides, the helpline got 1,677 calls with questions on the coronavirus and 237 seeking help for those who are sick. Walia has suggested the helpline be declared an essential service during the lockdown. Many women who are victims of domestic violence are also more vulnerable during the lockdown. National Commission of Women chairperson Rekha Sharma recently said domestic violence complaints have been increasing by the day since the nationwide lockdown was imposed with 69 complaints received just through email.Also read | Covid-19 lockdown: Rise in domestic violence, police apathy: NCW From March 24 till April 1, 257 complaints related to various offences against women were received. Of the 257, 69 complaints are related to domestic violence, the latest data released by the NCW showed. Sharma said the number of cases of domestic violence must be much higher but women are scared to complain due to the constant presence of their abusers at home. “Women are not approaching police because they think that if they take their husband away, her in-laws will then torture her. And he will, in turn, torture her more when he gets out of the police station. Earlier, women could go to their parents but now they are unable to reach them, Sharma told PTI, adding that the NCW is in touch with some of the complainants. India is currently under the biggest lockdown with around 1.3 billion people asked to stay home in view of the coronavirus outbreak, which has claimed at least 149 lives and infected more than 5,100 people.  Confinement is fostering the tension and strain created by security, health, and money worries. And it is increasing isolation for women with violent partners, separating them from the people and resources that can best help them. It’s a perfect storm for controlling, violent behaviour behind closed doors, UN Women Executive Director Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka said in a statement calling the violence against women and girls a shadow pandemic. Child rights bodies recently wrote to the Prime Minister’s Office, asking the government to declare 1098 toll free and to make it a COVID-19 emergency outreach number for children or parents or caregivers. In a joint statement, an alliance of six leading child development organisations (ChildFund India, Plan India, Save the Children India, SOS Children’s Villages of India, Terre des hommes and World Vision India) on April 2 also asked the government to provide uninterrupted access to critical services for the most vulnerable children and their families. “To overcome the immediate and long-term impact of the crisis, the government should ensure, on priority basis: access to critical services such as healthcare, nutrition, food security, mental health and psychosocial support, protection against violence and ensure social protection and child-sensitive cash transfer initiatives to the most vulnerable children and poorest families,” the child rights bodies said."

It turned out to be a false hope.Naturally, she was disappointed. “I used to return home after work with the bag. I would go to the bathroom straight and wash my clothes in hot water so that my husband and children would be safe. Of course, we were scared for our families,” said the woman in her fifties, who has been working as a nurse at the LNJP hospital for the past two decades.The nurse, who lives in Mayur Vihar stated that other nurses too used to carry bags in the beginning and after repeated requests, the hospital gave them rooms about 10 days later.

But on our floor, there are other nurses who are still working in COVID wards and we even have to share bathrooms with them. We go back after our shifts and sometimes wait for an hour to get the bathroom as everyone’s shift gets over at the same time and each one will be washing their clothes,” narrated Laila, who felt home was better.Even as the nurses are struggling, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on March 30 that the government had arranged 100 individual rooms in The Lalit, a five-star hotel, for the doctors who are treating in COVID-19 wards. “We do not want any five-star rooms.

The exposure is more for sanitation staff as they clean these spaces. They are less educated than us and the government should provide proper quarantine facilities for them too,” she said.

He said that the about 250 Indian nationals, who are suffering from the disease, include some permanent residents. Of the infected Indians, nearly 50% are from dormitories for foreign workers, which have emerged as the disease spreading points in the country. The first cases from the dormitories were reported on March 29, but the number of infections has climbed to 460, of which about 200 were confirmed on Thursday. As the country has ramped up aggressive testing in the dormitories, the numbers are expected to climb in the next few days.

Noting that foreign workers will still be providing public services such as cleaning, Wong urged people not to be prejudiced against them.“It’s not because of a foreign worker being inherently of higher risk - the risk of infection for the rest of us in the population is the same, regardless of nationality, regardless of race,” he stressed.

So, I went straight to the terrace and bathed in hot water and washed my clothes and then only I met anyone in the house,” the sanitation worker said. The government did not provide him with any accommodation, he said. The Delhi government has provided accommodation for doctors and nurses who are on COVID-19 duty, but he said that there were no such facilities for sanitation workers.“About 15 people who were working with me left the job after we were given duty in COVID-19 wards. Sabko apni jaan pyaari hai na?” said Vinod.“In between, I was unwell and took medicines. I got really scared and spoke to my parents. They advised me not to work for a while,” he said, who earns ₹13,000 a month.The sanitation worker said he was given PPE (Personal Protection Equipment) to clean the wards, rooms, toilets used by COVID-19 patients, but not while washing bedsheets used by patients. “After the COVID-19 patients started coming, they asked us to wash their bedsheets and also the pink gown worn by doctors and nurses. Many times, the bedsheets were dirty,” said Vinod, who works at the hospital through a private company.“We were not given protective kits (PPE) for washing and were only given the OT (operation theatre) gowns. I had to dip about 15 bedsheets in a big plastic drum and then add bleach and a chemical to it. Many a times, my clothes got wet as it did not cover the whole body,” he said.He said that the PPE given to them was very thin and sometimes would tear or the zip won’t work. “When it tears, we do not realise it at that time and later only we notice it. Then we go to the nurse and get a white tape and fix the kit with it. We clean their rooms and toilets. We should also be given better facilities,” Vinod, hailing from Uttar Pradesh, said.On March 30, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that the government had arranged 100 individual rooms in The Lalit, a five-star hotel, for the doctors who are treating in COVID-19 wards.Following multiple complaints by nurses, the government announced better accommodation for nurses on Thursday. The worker, said, “We do not get any facilities and no one complains, because if we complain, the company will sack us.”Also, though Delhi has a 14-day work and 14-day quarantine plan for health workers and medical professionals who are on COVID-19 duty, Vinod said that there were no such facility for sanitation workers. No responseWhen reached out for a comment, J.C. Passey, medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital, said, “I am at a meeting”. He did not respond to multiple calls and messages following it. The Delhi government spokesperson also did not offer a response on the issue.“Our union is for government workers and not contractual workers, but currently we are looking into contract workers also.

The benefit of parole/interim bail/remission may be extended to all of us. We too are humans and are at risk of contracting COVID-19,” stated the representation made to the HPC, chaired by Justice Hima Kohli.The representation, made through advocate Ajay Verma, also highlighted that, “there are many foreign women (lodged inside of the Jail No. 6 of Central Jail Tihar) medically ill, who are most vulnerable and have serious risk of infection of corona”.They urged the HPC to consider relaxing the norms for interim release or emergency parole in view of the risks.No relaxationRecently, the HPC relaxed the criteria for the release of undertrial prisoners on interim bail from Delhi jails. The HPC, however, recommended that the under-trial prisoners, who are foreign nationals, will not be given the relaxation. Recently, the Delhi High Court ordered the city government to release undertrial prisoners (UTPs), who are unable to furnish surety bond, on their furnishing a personal bond to decongest jails during the COVID-19 lockdown.The decision was taken after the Supreme Court took up the issue of overcrowding of prisons, as a matter of serious concern, pursuant to the spread of COVID-19 across the globe and it is declared as a pandemic by the World Health Organization.Mr. Verma, in a letter to the HPC, said that the foreign national women lodged in Central Jail No. 6 after learning that they have been excluded from the easing of the parole and interim bail norms panicked and “...raised the issue with the Superintendant...”. They then decided to make a collective representation before the HPC, he said.After the easing of the norms, the HPC was apprised by D.G (Prisons) that the Jail Population has come down from 17,552 as on March 25 to 16,179 as on April 7. On complete implementation of the new criteria, the number would further come down."

After spending several days sleeping inside the departure terminal, the group was taken for coronavirus tests, and once they were cleared, allowed to check into the airport hotel, said officials.‘In constant touch’“We have been in constant touch with some of them and with local authorities and Emirates airlines, who have put them in the airport hotel.

On April 9, the UAE government sent a note verbale to all Embassies in Abu Dhabi, asking them to repatriate their citizens who needed to return, offering to help with flight arrangements, ensuring COVID-19 tests for them all, and hospital treatment for those found to be positive.Also read | Thousands of Indians stranded overseas are disheartened as govt. refuses to lift passenger ban“This includes travellers, naturally, but also any nationals who seek to go back to their homes and families,” UAE Ambassador Mohammad Al Banna told The Hindu on Saturday.However, India’s Ambassador to the UAE Pavan Kapoor said a day later that no Indian could be repatriated until after the lockdown had ended.“It is totally wrong to say that we are abandoning our citizens.

As a result, the government has refused to lift the travel ban, despite dozens of flights coming in to collect foreign nationals and take them home, even if it means the flights come to India completely empty. Germany, France, Spain, Brazil and Russia have already completed most of their evacuation flights, while the U.S. and U.K. have put out final calls for their nationals to register to fly back. This will mean that when India does lift the travel ban, it will also need to organise special flights to bring back the thousands stranded outside the country."

Senior DGCA officials said they were working on a plan that would be announced when they were ready.Among the new measures for ensuring safe operations are rear boarding to reduce contact with other passengers, setting a limit of six passengers on the step ladder to the aircraft, and allotting fewer seats out of the full capacity. Airports like Mumbai have also considered using just one terminal till flying picks up, to save costs.Airlines said they are reducing the number of passengers who board and, ultimately, travel on each flight. A video released by SpiceJet showed the low-cost carrier conduct mock drills of its staff to prepare them for the new rules, which will be soon notified by the DGCA. The airlines have also started marking the floor of airport coaches for passengers to stand. Boarding will also be spaced out with the aerobridge and step ladder being marked with numbering.“In the case of a step ladder, six passengers will board at a time, leaving a gap of three steps in between. While the entire time taken from entering the airport to boarding will go up, passengers, in the absence of a dry run, will have to exercise the utmost patience,” said a SpiceJet official who participated in the mock drill.IndiGo too has initiated markings on the floor and seats of its airport coaches. The airline will not serve on-board meals for a while after service resumes. Only passengers wearing masks and cooperating with officials in implementing the new rules on ground and in air will be allowed access.The new COVID-19 rules for flying will require airlines to keep the middle row empty, officials said. The airlines are also looking at Atlanta-based carrier Delta, which till May 31, is boarding its flights from back to front.“Passengers are asked to stay seated in the waiting area until their row is announced. By boarding from back to front, there is less chance of passengers passing each other as they find their seats,” said Jai Bhatia, vice-president, Travel Agents Association of India.In a mail to IndiGo employees last week, CEO Ronojoy Dutta said the airline coaches will operate at a maximum load of 50% capacity. The airline, he said, was looking to change many operating procedures to minimise costs. “We will be coming out with the new set of operating procedures soon,” the CEO said.New airport protocolsAirports, on the other hand, are initiating their own protocols. Thermal checking of passengers will be compulsory. The Central Industrial Security Force too has proposed changes to the way passengers use the airport once services resume.The new protocol includes suggestions on restricting passengers in any given area and asking them to report two hours prior to the flight time. This practice will be ensured during the check-in and security check procedure. A sanitising tunnel has also been recommended.Airports Authority of India-run Goa Airport, which has operated 21 relief flights carrying 3,500 tourists since March 25, has become a testing ground for post-lockdown rules of flying. Having seats in the Dabolim airport terminal have been marked for seating, while middle ones are to be left unoccupied. “Besides making markings at the security hold area, touchpoints like seats, railings and trolleys are constantly being sanitised by our staff,” Goa airport director Gagan Malik told The Hindu. A Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport post on social media said staff were ensuring extensive deep-cleaning and sanitisation at the airport to ensure a coronavirus-free environment in anticipation of passengers returning. At Mumbai airport, hough no final call has been taken yet, senior airport management had as early as March 11 considered the usage of a single operational terminal (T2) till the situation normalises. While all private airlines are available to book after April 15, national carrier Air India has stopped accepting new bookings till April 30. If that is any indication as to when one could board their next flight, it comes with a condition: responsible social distancing."

The university said that it has been trying to devise feasible methods to continue academic activities but it was difficult to have a one-size-fits-all mechanism.“Given that JNU students come from different parts of India and there exists a complex set of problems, including Internet connectivity issues in rural areas, a flexible yet efficient mechanism will be devised by the Deans of Schools and Chairpersons of Special Centres to help students in completing their academic requirements,” Registrar Pramod Kumar said. Wider consultation will be held on April 16 with faculty on how to complete courses, hold examinations, and facilitate dissertations/thesis guidance and submissions, after which a final decision will be reported to the Academic Council.Vice-Chancellor M. Jagadesh Kumar said that the university is organising workshops on empowering teaching through online mode to enable the JNU faculty to become familiar with digital platforms. “Using digital platforms to reach out to students during these challenging times is very important to keep the teaching-learning processes going,” Mr. Kumar said.Reacting to the administration’s proposal, the JNU Teachers’ Association suggested that the period from mid-or end-May till mid- or end-July, including what would usually be summer vacation period, could be used to complete teaching and sessional work in regular mode.“This method of effectively extending the semester, in combination with a continuation of online engagement with students to the extent possible in the period before, would certainly be a more meaningful option than what has been suggested by the administration,” the teachers said.The JNUTA added that any decision without due process will not be acceptable to the faculty. “No matter what the compulsions, teachers cannot accept a purely formal completion of the semester that reduces it to a farce. Teachers also stand ready to make the extra effort needed to ensure proper completion of the academic requirements prescribed,” the statement said."

He has found refuge in a government school-cum-shelter home in Tihar Village near Subhash Nagar.When Sharma, a resident of Jalandhar, Punjab, called his parents to inform them about his release, they were both happy and sad. Premature release“They did not know I was going to be released early on April 4. When I called them in the evening after I was released, they were shocked. Their first reaction was to drive all the way and get me. For that, however, they would require a movement pass and I did not want my aged parents to go through the hassle,” he said.Sharma was supposed to be released in May but jail authorities decided to let him off early on account of good conduct, he said.Sharma, a software engineer, was in the U.S. when he was accused of quarrelling with a man online. “The man lodged a complaint in South Delhi’s Mehrauli police station in 2013 and then an FIR was registered under the IT Act. When I came to India in 2015, I gave my statement to the police and went back. I didn’t want the case to go to trial so I pleaded guilty in 2018 when I came here. I was sentenced to one-year imprisonment,” he said. But his parents bailed him out after three months and he went to Dubai for work. He finally surrendered again in August 2019 to complete the remaining period.Inside the jail, as everyone knew about the lockdown, Sharma said, “I never imagined I would say this, but I asked the jail authorities if I could stay in the prison till April 14 because I had no means to go home but they denied”.Shelter facility After stepping out, he asked one of the officials where could he possibly go and was informed of a shelter facility in SDMC Primary School in Tihar Village. He walked a few metres and then found an e-rickshaw which dropped him.With the stamp from Tihar jail still on his left arm, he walked into the school and has been staying and helping since then. At the government school, he has been tasked with maintaining a record of people who are taking food for the school authorities and to inform the District Magistrate office for further requirement. “It is probably because I am educated and most importantly, I am healthy,” he said.Talking about his time in the facility, he said that he spends all day surfing the Internet, watching videos and movies. A friend from Tilak Nagar met him on April 4 and handed him a mobile phone among other things.Jail hygieneAs far as his time in prison is concerned, he said that officials seemed to be only concerned with their own hygiene and most prisoners are living like they used to. “If one person contracts the virus, they won’t be able to control the spread, such is the condition,” he said.Standing next to him was the school’s security guard Jasveer Singh Meharolia who has been managing the food and shelter along with school principal Anita Rani.A retired Indo-Tibetan Border Police Havaldar Dharamvir (59), hailing from Haryana’s Jhajjar, who is also stuck here praised the duo for maintaining hygiene at the school. He too shared his story of reaching the school. Before the lockdown, he had gone to Kanpur to collect rent for his property and got stuck. On April 6, he reached Delhi in a fruit vendor’s truck till Azadpur Mandi where he managed to get a newspaper. “I read about this school turning into a shelter for people. I took lift from a constable till Punjabi Bagh and then another lift from a person till Raja Garden and then walked about 5 km to reach here,” said Mr. Dharamvir. His two sons are serving the nation in the Army posted in Sikkim and Jammu.Sharma listened to him intently. “I just can’t wait to go home,” he sighed."

Mr. Aejaz was in the process of writing a chapter in a book to be published by Routledge he said, but without access to a library and to e-resources and journals, carrying out the work had become difficult.While the extension of the lockdown didn’t come as surprise to him, his daughter was of the belief that the Prime Minister would announce an end to it on Tuesday morning, he said. “She really wanted to return to school... but was disappointed,” he added.Sense of dutyFor Rajiv Jain, in South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), the work of engaging on the frontline as part of the sanitation department, carried with it a sense of duty. “We can’t be afraid,” he said. Though his family was perennially worried for his health and well being, Mr. Jain said that just as doctors, nurses and policemen, sanitation staff was on the frontline of this battle and had to do its job to help overcome the present crisis. The extension of the lockdown was inevitable, he said.For some, the impact that COVID-19 had on their life began even before the lockdown. Vinay Agarwal, an electronics trader at Nehru Place said that trade had been completely shut with his store employees having returned home. “Business was already down since when the virus hit China. Stocks were low and we weren’t sure how long we could manage,” he said. Now with the imposition and the extension of the lockdown, Mr. Agarwal said that the focus was on ensuring that there were enough resources to take care of his family, while extending whatever little help they could to the people that worked for them."

Addressing an online briefing, Mr. Kejriwal urged people to strictly follow all precautionary measures and guidelines.He also termed it a matter of concern that COVID-19 cases were increasing in the Capital and expressed disappointment over reports of certain elements trying to create a divide between different communities. He also said that he would visit some COVID-19 containment zones on Wednesday to take stock of the situation.“Today, the PM extended the lockdown till May 3, which I think was necessary. The people of Delhi have consistently supported us in the last few days by following all the rules and restrictions imposed on them during the lockdown. I believe that if we continue to strictly follow the rules for the remaining phase of the lockdown, we will be able to win our battle against COVID-19,” he said.“Even the most developed nations...have been affected by COVID-19. Just 3-4 months ago, who could have imagined that the whole world would be impacted by the pandemic and nations would be helpless in front of it...Kindness and helpfulness have been inscribed in the Geeta, and when a person goes against these traits, he suffers at the hands of nature. He is working against nature, against God, against Allah...It saddens me that in the time of the pandemic, there are still people who are trying to create a divide between Hindus and Muslims. I observe on social media that even in times when the whole world is in distress, people are trying to create a rift between the two communities, by posting hate videos and content,” he said.Because Delhi is the Capital, it has been burdened with infections as many passengers from other nations landed in the city in the last two months. COVID-19 entered India because of this influx of people from those nations. An incident related to religious gathering also caused additional burden, said the Chief Minister.On April 9, the city saw 51 new cases, but on April 10, 183 new cases were reported, on April 11, 166 new cases were observed and on April 13, 356 new cases were reported.Operation SHIELD“We will overcome this. We have identified many containment zones in the last few days, which have been mapped by sealing areas that have three or more COVID-19 cases. Operation SHIELD has been implemented to contain the spread. We are using 60 high-tech sanitising machines. Around 14,000 personnel are working across Delhi to spread awareness about COVID-19,” he said.“I know that this lockdown is causing a lot of difficulties for the common man but we can only defeat COVID-19 by following the lockdown protocol systematically... We have started the process of providing ₹5,000 compensation to para-transit drivers. I have received some complaints regarding the non-functioning of the website, which is because the portal is overloaded as many people are registering on the portal at one go. I want to appeal to all the people registering on the portal to stay patient. Every one of you will be provided the compensation,” he said."

348,Delhi,"April 15, 2020 23:34 IST",Delhi,Greater Noida,Unofficial restriction on selling meat hits retailers,"Meat retailers at one of the most prominent wholesale markets in Greater Noida complain they are reeling under a double whammy. First, it was the Navratras, when demand dips to non-existent levels; then came the inexplicable restrictions allegedly placed on sale of meat during the first installment of the nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of COVID-19. Accusing the authorities of forcing them to shut shops, based mostly on alleged apprehension that consuming meat can lead to contraction of COVID-19, retailers said they have to sell their existing stock clandestinely. They are selling with half-downed shutters and consumers are requested to conceal bags containing the meat. Hoping for better days As the second installment of the lockdown came into effect on Wednesday, shopkeepers and customers said they hoped for better days if relaxations kick in on April 20 as announced by the Ministry of Home Affairs. They, however, wondered how long the supply chain would take to resurrect itself.“They [authorities] came on March 25 and ordered us to shut our shops. We thought it was because of the Navratras, but when we opened up again on April 3, a day after the festival ended, we were forced to shut down again. Some of us tried to argue that our products were clearly essential items because they were foodstuff. We were told that meat caused COVID-19. That was all,” said a retailer, choosing to stand a distance from his shop to keep an eye out for any “trouble” as his younger brother hurriedly prepared an order for a customer. Mutton prices soared to ₹600 over the weekend before it became unavailable due to lack of supply on Monday. Chicken is selling for ₹200 per kg while fish, in the absence of storage arrangements, has not been available for weeks, said shopkeepers. “I have heard about the new guidelines but they will come into effect four days later. Who knows how long it will take for the supply chain to become operational. Many small retailers will go out of business by then,” said a shopkeeper.“We have been struggling to finish even the minuscule stock we had. I had nine chickens on March 24. Almost three weeks later, I still have six left because the authorities turn away the customers,” complained another retailer.“Most of my stock of mutton and fish had to be thrown away because the person who I used to buy ice from isn’t allowed to operate because of the lockdown. If things continue like this, I will have to sell my shop,” said a shopkeeper.Lack of clarity Customers questioned the lack of clarity regarding the sale of meat products. “It is all food. Isn’t it? I was asked to return and told I would contract COVID-19 if I ate meat,” said Manish Singh, a resident of Omega I."

The Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee, on April 4, had already issued the detailed order to be implemented from April 6 to control the crowd.The vegetable mandi is divided into four blocks (A, B, C and D) and 116 sheds. The fruits mandi has 19 sheds. The order stated that blocks B and D and sheds 1-56 will operate on three days while blocks A and C and sheds 57-116 will operate the remaining three days. Similarly, for fruits, even numbered sheds are to operate on even days and odd ones, the rest. Also, vegetables are to be sold from 6 a.m.-11 a.m. and fruits from 2 p.m.-6 p.m., according to the order.No one follows rulesHowever, the system seemed to be crumbling as a miniscule number of people were found following the rules and many were unaware even as Civil Defence officials, Rapid Action Force, Delhi Police and government officials deployed at the mandi tried hard to bring order.Vegetable vendors identified as Sanjay, Mahender Singh, and Jagga operating in D-Block claimed that they were unaware of the odd-even policy. A labourer, aware of the rule, identified as Rampati said, “No one is really following the rules here. It’s not possible to manage thousands of people. Policemen force them to leave and they come back again,” he said. An onion trader, Rakesh, said that while people aren’t following rules, restrictions have been put. “If we are four partners in the trade, only one is allowed,” he said.Madan Lal Rajeev Kumar, a fruit vendor in shed number 4 who adhered to the rule, said, “People are hardly following the rules. Fruits are to be sold from 2 p.m. but they are being sold in the morning. The place around is so dirty. This is probably the only place where there is traffic jam,” he said.Another trader said, “Fruits and vegetables are perishable, that’s the reason it’s tough to follow. If a truck full of vegetables or fruits arrives on an even day and the trader can sell on odd, what can be done”.However, the crowd had visibly lessened. The reason, though, didn’t appear to be adherence to the policy but, that small vendors and retailers inside the mandi have been removed by enforcement agencies. Zakir held his seven-month-old son, while his wife Bano took care of the small sack full of vegetables which they planned to sell in the next few hours but they were scared. “Every day we are beaten up by policemen but we come back because how else will we earn and feed our little sons. For how long will we depend on free food? We could have gone home but even that’s not allowed,” said Bano, hailing from Haryana’s Palwal.Guddu, who sells on a cart in Shalimar Bagh and had come to buy vegetables, said that he comes walking every day because now, his cart is not allowed inside. “All the rich traders are still doing fine, we are the ones who are suffering,” he said.Other small vendors also said that they were not allowed to come inside without any reason on Tuesday and allowed with much difficulty and no vehicle on Wednesday.Inside the mandi, several small trucks also stood as the drivers waited for customers. A driver identified as Trimohan Chauhan said that he ferried vegetables for vendors who would come to buy here for smaller mandis across Delhi but are not coming nowadays because those mandis are shut. However, truck drivers coming from outside Delhi said that they didn’t face any problems because they had permissions.A Delhi Police officer on duty and another from enforcement squad walked around with sticks trying to control crowd and making sure people followed rules but they said that no one was willing to abide by law there."

This is quite contrary to what most reports had suggested. Bookings from May 4 were on Wednesday available at return fare ranging from ₹4,829 to ₹7,438 on the Delhi-Mumbai sector, the busiest in the country. Fares on this sector, usually at a premium because of summer vacation, were available starting at ₹2,500 (one way) by IndiGo through is website and app. The lowest return fare on this sector was being offered by Air India at ₹4,829 while the highest return fare was on SpiceJet for ₹7,438.

Travel portal Cleartrip showed that a total of 65 flights will be available between Delhi-Mumbai, 25 between Delhi-Chennai and 40 from Delhi to Bengaluru on May 4. The fare brackets are similar for the next few weeks.Travel agents were, however, quick to add a word of caution for anyone jumping to book tickets. “The lockdown has not been lifted yet. Life after May 3 will not be the same as before for air travel. There cannot be crowding inside terminals, check-in, boarding gates and aircraft among other things,” Reji Philip, a south Mumbai-based corporate travel booking agent, saidMr. Philip added that those booking tickets now should also be prepared for flights to be cancelled due to amended government rules or merging of flights due to poor loads.

Gangakhedkar, however, said these testing kits will be used for surveillance and to monitor whether coronavirus hotspots in the country are increasing or decreasing.Regarding concern over the efficacy of the rapid antibody testing kits, he said if an antibody test of a person turns out to be positive, one cannot necessarily be sure the person would not get infected ever again. “This means, even if antibody is present, that doesn’t mean it will necessarily be effectively able to fight the virus.”“Rapid antibody tests are for monitoring surveillance, not for diagnosis. Hence there is no concern with respect to the testing kits being faulty, that concern was with respect to immune response alone,” Dr. Gangakhedkar explained.Earlier in the day sources confirmed that a large consignment of testing kits for the novel coronavirus pandemic were scheduled to reach India from China on Thursday. According to available information, 5.5 lakh Rapid Antibody Testing Kits sourced from Guangzhou Wondfo and Zhuhai Livzon and 1 lakh RNA Extraction Kits from MGI Shenzhen were among the consignment.The consignment is part of the total order of 15 million personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and 1.5 million rapid testing kits that India had ordered from China. The Hindu had reported earlier that India had called upon China to fulfil those orders, amid concerns over tightened regulations on exporting such equipment by China after several Western countries complained over quality of exports.Vikram Misri, India’s ambassador to China said in an online interaction with reporters on Tuesday that deliveries of the medical supplies for India would be stretched until the end of April.

However, a decision was taken not to evacuate the affected nationals spread across the world because of the highly contagious nature of the novel coronavirus that causes the infection.Watch | Guidelines for extended lockdown“There is no shortage of quarantine facilities in India. In fact, the nature of the virus is such that it spreads very fast. Therefore it is good that they remain where they are to avoid further spreading the virus, both in their host countries as well as in India,” said the source. India evacuated a few batches of citizens from Italy, Iran and China in the initial phase of the pandemic in February and early March, but subsequently has asked the citizens abroad to “stay put” where they are.The official said that a total of 3,336 Indians spread across 53 countries have tested positive for the novel coronavirus and 25 Indians have died in the consequent COVID-19 infection. Out of the total, around 2,061 are in Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, UAE, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia. On the northern coast of the Gulf, Iran also continues to host around 308 affected Indians, mainly in the cities of Qom and Tehran.Data | How quickly are coronavirus infections and deaths increasing in India, compared to the rest of the world?Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been in frequent contact with the Arab leaders of the member states of the Gulf Cooperation Council over the last two months as the cases increased among the blue collar Indian expats. The health related issues of the Indian workers in the region had been taken up most recently by Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, who wrote to Mr. Modi expressing concern about the “well being of Indian diaspora” in the region, especially in Dubai.The United Arab Emirates has extended an offer to evacuate all affected Indian nationals following required medical tests, though New Delhi is yet to respond to that gesture. Earlier, on April 13, India sent a Rapid Response Team to Kuwait which held interactions with officials there, as the Gulf monarchy emerged as the largest host of Indians affected by the novel coronavirus abroad. The United Arab Emirates is also among the 54 countries where India is supplying the anti-malarial drug HydroxyChloroquine which is being tried in COVID-19 treatment. Apart from the Gulf nations, Singapore with 634 Indians is the other big hot spot. Italy (91), Malaysia (37), Portugal (36), Ghana (29), U.S. (24), Switzerland (15) and France (13) are some of the other countries on the list.To deal with the emerging situation, the Ministry of External Affairs set up a COVID-19 Control Room in March to serve as the nodal body for dealing with the Indians and their families living abroad. Giving an impression of the extent of the interaction with people who have reached out to the nodal body, the official said that around 18,000 emails have been answered by the COVID-19 Control Room in the last few weeks.

He has been lodged in jail for over six years.The prosecution opposed the bail plea saying nothing has been placed on record to show that the man’s father died on April 9 due to drowning and contended that the allegations against him are serious in nature as he is accused of raping a minor girl."

Both ambulances have been impounded.Those arrested included 10 migrant workers belonging to East and West Champaran districts of Bihar.Fake documentsThe workers had paid ₹7,000 each to Suresh, the manager of Vedic Hospital, to prepare fake documents to help them transport to their hometowns. Staying on rent in Khandsa village, the workers were employed with a private firm in Gurugram and were without jobs due to lockdown.The incident came to light when a team of Badshahpur police station, on routine check at Vatika Chowk on Sohna Road, grew suspicious on seeing a large number of occupants in the two ambulances approaching them and flagged them down. On being enquired, the ambulance drivers presented papers of one Hazson Hospital in Gurugram. The police called up the contacts given on the papers and found that one of them belonged to a State outside Haryana and the other number was switched off. It raised further suspicion.When the police further enquired, the drivers spilled the beans. They revealed that the owner of the ambulances, Sanjay, in connivance with Suresh had prepared the fake documents to transport the workers to their villages. The workers told the police that Suresh contacted them and offered to transport them to their villages in return for cash.While two of the workers, Akhilesh Pandey and Prabhu Ram, impersonated as patients with bandages and drips, the rest disguised as their relatives.Badshahpur Station House Officer, Inspector Mukesh Kumar said the ambulance drivers and owners had no previous involvement. He, however, added that Suresh was being interrogated to find out whether he had facilitated more people to return to their homes in a similar manner.A case has been registered against the accused on charges of forgery, cheating, disobedience to the orders duly promulgated by the public servant and criminal conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code, among others."

Some said they would take additional precautions while others admitted they would continue to order due to a lack of alternatives. A 19-year-old pizza-delivery boy, who operated in south Delhi, tested positive for COVID-19 earlier this week, prompting the authorities to quarantine a total of 72 houses in the areas he had delivered food. All these houses are within a five-kilometre radius of Malviya Nagar, said B.M. Mishra, District Magistrate (south Delhi). “A total of 17 people, including the owner of the shop, the delivery boy and other delivery boys, have been put under institutional quarantine. The shop has been shut,” he added.Mr. Mishra said the delivery man, a migrant worker from Uttar Pradesh, used a mask and a pair of gloves while working and was currently under treatment in Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital. “We are yet to ascertain how he got infected with the virus,” he said.Not anymore“When I heard about this, I didn’t really feel anything…with everything that is going on these days, this is just another drop in the ocean,” said Meenal Manolika, a resident of Malviya Nagar, where the delivery person was reportedly operating. Ms. Manolika and her roommates have, however, decided to stop getting things delivered home. “We have just ordered from BigBasket twice till now, but we won’t do that anymore,” she said.For Arunima Tara, a resident of Saket, the development was unlikely to change her ordering patterns. While she only cooks food at home and orders groceries online, she said that whether she went to the store or ordered them online, the risk of catching the virus was the same.Added precautionsAkshath Dharmadheeran, who stays in Indirapuram, said that some groceries were being delivered home almost every other day. While Mr. Dharmadheeran expressed shock at the news of 72 houses being quarantined after coming in contact with the delivery person, he said he would continue availing the service with added precautions.“There are options for contact-less delivery. I never meet the delivery person. And I go with a mask and wash my hands immediately,” he said.Sam Solomon, who lives in Gadipur, said he had been avoiding food delivery though he had been tempted. Now it is best to cook. “I had been concerned about this, and the current case only validates that,” he said, informing that he would not be ordering from outside anymore."
363,Delhi,"April 16, 2020 23:39 IST",Delhi,New Delhi,City hospital sacks doctor,"A doctor, identified as Piyush Pushkar Singh, at Hindu Rao Hospital was terminated from duty on Wednesday for “bringing disrepute to the institution”. Calling it baseless, the doctor said to challenge the decision in court.North Delhi Municipal Commissioner Varsha Joshi, under whose jurisdiction the hospital falls, alleged that Dr. Singh had intercepted stocks of protective gear meant for the hospital store room, donated by an NGO to distribute to hospital staff.“Dr. Piyush Pushkar Singh, DNB student in Orthopaedics Department is terminated from his services with immediate effect for bringing disrepute to the institution,” an order issued on Wednesday said. The medical superintendent of the hospital was in touch with the NGO regarding the equipment which included face masks. However, Dr. Singh allegedly portrayed himself as an authorised person from the RDA [Resident Doctors Association] and distributed the equipment himself, said Ms. Joshi. “Thus, he not only misled the donor, defied the MS, and diverted the material, but also gave it away to people who didn’t need it, taking decisions which were nowhere in his purview,” she said. Being a DNB student in the orthopaedics department, his termination would not effect the hospital’s capacity to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, she added.Rejected allegations Singh, however, rejected the allegation, stating that the NGO got in touch with him on its own accord, desiring to distribute protective gear to the RDA instead of the hospital administration, he said. He also said that the NGO had informed the hospital authorities regarding the same.“If an NGO donates some equipment in my name, won’t I give it to whoever I choose to,” he said, adding “I’ve always raised my voice over issues at the hospital.” While the commissioner said that the protective gear should have been sent to the hospital store to be distributed according to protocol, Dr. Singh said that resident doctors here had asked him not to do so. Donated gear being deposited to the hospital store was not being appropriately distributed to staff and was lying in waste, he said. Show-cause noticeDr. Singh was also issued a show-cause notice last month for putting up a video on Facebook highlighting issues at the hospital.“He indulged in theft. I am an employer. I’m not going to tolerate it, not at such a time. No employer would,” said Ms. Joshi in another tweet."
364,Delhi,"April 16, 2020 23:31 IST",National,NEW DELHI,"Coronavirus | More travel time, no frills, higher fare are new normal","Passengers taking a flight must prepare for a longer travel time, temperature checks, fewer frills on board and possibly higher air fares, as airlines, airports and the government work to ensure physical distancing, hand hygiene and sanitised environment to keep the novel coronavirus infection at bay once the lockdown is lifted. Also read: Airlines prepare for take-off in post-coronavirus world“The key aspect we have to keep in mind is the safety of passengers by ensuring social distancing so that the infection does not spread. This means travel time will increase. Where passengers were asked to report 45 minutes before the departure time (for domestic flights), they will now have to report two hours earlier. We will encourage passengers to use automated modes as much as possible to avoid manual contact. For example, they may be asked to check in through the mobile application or self check-in kiosks, which will undergo frequent cleaning,” Vistara chief commercial officer Vinod Kannan told The Hindu in a telephone interview.GoAir, however, requires its passengers to report three hours before a flight.“The Ministry of Civil Aviation, the Airports Authority of India (AAI), the safety regulator DGCA and the aviation security watchdog Bureau of Civil Aviation Security are finalising guidelines for airports and airlines. Several airports have already started marking circles and squares at various contact points on their premises,” AAI Chairman Arvind Singh said.Also read: Coronavirus lockdown | Airlines start selling domestic flight ticketsThe CISF has submitted its recommendations on security protocol to the Ministry of Civil Aviation, which include measurement of body temperature at the airport entrance, filling up of a questionnaire on health conditions by passengers, only alternate check-in counters being opened and security personnel equipped with protective gear. CISF airport in charge M.A. Ganapathy said that at the time of entering the terminal building, passengers would be asked to remove their mask for identification by security personnel and CCTV cameras. Once you board the flight, the middle row seat is likely to be left empty, in accordance with the DGCA guidelines, or possibly four out of six seats in a row could be left empty. While low-cost airlines IndiGo and GoAir will discontinue meals on board, Vistara will continue to provide them, with some changes in the delivery.“In order to ensure a superior quality of service, our cabin crew members interact with passengers several times and explain the menu. We will limit the number of interactions. We will offer pre-packaged cold meals to minimise contact,” Mr. Kannan said.Passengers must also be prepared for a costlier travel so that airlines can operate flights in a cost-efficient manner despite being required to leave 33%-50% of their flights empty.“If we are operating only two-thirds of our flight capacity, the cost per ticket will go up. But airfare is a function of supply and demand and we can’t predict the nature of demand. We know that in the first few days, there will be a lot of demand from passengers, but what happens thereafter is uncertain,” Mr. Kannan said. Vistara and other airlines have already announced that they will remove all reading materials from seat-back pockets, clean the aircraft after every flight and deep-clean the aircraft after every 24 hours and provide passengers with hand-sanitisers and masks.With multiple agencies involved in minimising the risk of infection, Mr. Kannan advises passengers to travel free of stress. “This is not an easy time, but air travel is the safest mode. The air inside the plane is re-circulated through HEPA filters to minimise infection. Just remember to wear your mask and factor in extra time.”"

They were being hunted down and placed under quarantine amid propaganda that they were “hiding” and “evading”, it said.“Mere past relationship of someone with the religious congregation in New Delhi does not make him a suspect. Instead, only those who were inside the centre or visited it or came in contact with such persons outside the centre after the epidemic was discovered should be searched and quarantined,” the DMC said.“In many places in the country, members of the group are being hunted only because they belong to the Tablighi Jamaat with no proof that they were in the religious gathering at the said time or came in contact with anyone who was there at the time,” it said. Issue instructionsThe commission requested the Home Minister to issue instructions to the police and health officers not to harass the members of the group who were not part of the religious gathering at the given time or had no contact with those who were stranded there when the lockdown was declared. “While every Tablighi is a Muslim, not every Muslim is a Tablighi. This has caused harassment of Muslims in both urban and rural areas across the country.

In May 1974 during the strike of the railways that lasted for around three weeks, drivers, station masters, guards, track staff and many others went on ‘chakka jam’ demanding fixed working hours for train drivers and an across-the-board pay hike.“I can recall those times vividly.

But he has been hiding something from them: Akash was tested positive for COVID-19 and is admitted at a hospital.A total of 31 people connected to the DSCI have tested positive for the virus so far, including staff, patients, and a two-year-old child of a nurse. Though DSCI is not a COVID-19 treatment facility, the hospital was closed for sanitation on April 1, after a doctor tested positive.“If I tell them that I have tested positive, they will worry a lot. So, I have not told them about it. I have told my younger brother and my sister’s husband in Dubai,” Akash told The Hindu over phone from Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH).Multiple issuesHe complained about “lack” of facilities at RGSSH, where he and other staff from DSCI are currently admitted. Another DSCI staff, who was tested positive and admitted at RGSSH, also raised multiple issues.“My results came on April 6 late evening and I waited for an ambulance, but I did not get one and I reached the hospital on my own. Here, they throw the daily medicines inside our room and leave the food outside the door on the floor. Can’t they at least keep the food and medicines on a table or chair outside the door?” he asked.Another staff, who tested positive and admitted at RGSSH, wrote in an internal WhatsApp group of DSCI staff: “Today morning 10 a.m. I went to ask water to drink, no one is ready to listen, [they were] just sitting in front of me. I called them by knocking the door [they were] simply sitting with no response at all. I was shocked. If they behave with staff like this, then how they deal the other general patient? This is such horrible and irresponsible worker here [sic].”Group dissolvedA senior DSCI official, part of the group, then dissolved the WhatsApp group. “On director’s instructions, I am dissolving the group,” the official wrote on the group, screenshots of which were accessed by The Hindu.Mr. Akash also said that the DSCI could have avoided staff being infected with the virus if they had provided PPE to employees after Dilshad Garden, where the hospital is located, became a hotspot for COVID-19 cases. “In March, around the lockdown, we asked the authorities for PPE multiple times. At that time, Dilshad Garden had already become a hotspot for the virus. Though we do not treat COVID-19 patients, we have an OPD and a lot of people came to meet patients who are admitted at the hospital. How will we know who is infected by the virus and who is not?” he asked.“These many staff getting infected could have been completely avoided if the authorities had given us PPE initially,” he lamented.“I was tested negative two days ago. According to procedures, I have to be tested again within 24 hours and if I am negative again, then they have to discharge me. But they are yet to test me and I am stuck here. There is no proper system here and procedures are not being followed,” Mr. Akash complained.DSCI director’s replyResponding to the allgations, B.L. Sherwal, Director of DSCI, told The Hindu that full-body PPE kits were not needed in DSCI as it is not a COVID-19 treatment facility.On the lack of facilities and other issues, he said, “Whatever our staff are pointing out might be true.

Replying to a letter from NHAI, the ministry said the NHAI in letters dated April 11 and 14 has highlighted reasons for resuming the collection of user fee on national highways, saying that the Ministry of Home Affairs has allowed a lot of activities with effect from April 20, including commercial and private establishments and construction activities.“It has been further highlighted that user fee collection contributes to the government exchequer and also provides financial strength to NHAI in terms of budgetary support,” the letter mentioned.‘Appallingly preposterous’However, transporters’ apex body All India Motor Transport Congress (AIMTC) has opposed the move.

Yet the government instead of extending this sector a helping hand by giving a bare minimum rescue package, submitted by AIMTC, it is burdening it with toll charges that account for 20 per cent of the operating costs.” Indian Foundation of Transport Research and Training (IFTRT) Coordinator SP Singh in the past 21 days the benefit of toll fee not being levied was hardly being passed on in form of any reduction in truck rentals across the country.“In view of COVID-19, it has been ordered to temporarily suspend the collection of toll at all toll plazas across India,” Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari had announced on March 25. This will not only reduce inconvenience to emergency services but also save critical time, he has said. The minister has said maintenance of roads and availability of emergency resources at toll plazas will continue as usual. Earlier, the road transport and highways ministry had advised the NHAI to follow the home ministry’s guidelines about toll plaza operations following the lockdown. The prevailing condition may be treated as “Force Majeure” of concession or contract agreement in terms of the finance ministry, it had said. The NHAI had rolled out the electronic toll collection programme across India in December on its over 500 toll plazas while doubling toll charges from the vehicles entering FASTag lanes without the tag."

The only change in the beggars’ lives after the COVID-19 outbreak is less money.When asked if she is aware of the pandemic, 10-year-old Santosh, unable to pronounce the term said, “‘Corona Varis’ chal raha hai, ye pata hain [coronavirus is spreading, I know),” she said.Public announcementsFor them, the source of information about the disease is mostly the announcements made on public speaker by police and government bodies about how to keep washing hands, use sanitisers, remain indoors, maintain distance. However, all these exercises don’t appear to fit in their meagre lifestyle.Santosh and Poonam said that a good Samaritan who had come in a “big car” two days ago provided them all with masks but they removed it. “It had become black and dirty so we threw it. They say keep washing hands. Here, if we are able to shower every day then it’s enough,” said Pooja (22), adding that they live in a tent of dupattas near a temple without a fan or electricity. “We all sleep together close to each other because of lack of space so there is no possibility of keeping distance”.But life has changed for them because there is dearth of vehicles on the road for them to ask for money. “Ek gaadi aati hai itni. Uspe kitne log maang lenge? Waise ek gaadi pe ek aadmi mangta hai [One car comes. How many of us can go beg. One person begs at one car),” said Rahul. Treated like patientsBut he said that those who are willing to give, the situation doesn’t stop them for being charitable. “There have been cases where we are treated by passersby like we are COVID-19 patients and that even asking them for money will spread the disease. However, there are a few people like that,” he said.While the government and the Delhi Police are making efforts to ensure that no one in the Capital sleeps on a hungry stomach, the beggars said that getting food was easier in the pre-COVID days. “Earlier, policemen would come give us food at least twice a day. Now, we only get sticks. They don’t let us beg here. They use sticks and force us to leave. That’s the reason why so many of us don’t even come on the roads now,” said Pooja.How do they spend their day? Santosh and Poonam take their stones and start playing."

Deepak, who had lost his wife two months ago, was penniless and set out to arrange some money so that he could buy milk and food for his daughter.Finding him in distress, a few Delhi Police officers helped him reach the government school-cum-shelter in west Delhi’s Tihar village. From then on, he has been staying in the shelter with his daughter.Deepak left his family in Uttam Nagar six years ago because of differences with his family and started doing odd jobs. In 2018, he met Neha and they got married. Next year, they were blessed with daughter Lavanya. “We were staying in Haryana near my wife’s parental house when she suffered a seizure and died. In January, we returned to Delhi. I took a house on rent in Aali village near Sarita Vihar,” he said.Ever since his wife’s death, Deepak has been taking Lavanya wherever he goes. “I used to go to Sadar Bazar to get cosmetics which I would sell in weekly markets across Delhi. I take her around everywhere. She sits with me when I sell articles,” he said.Life changingThe last time Deepak went to the weekly market was on March 18. After prohibitory orders were issued, his life changed. Within a few days, he ran out of money. For a while, his neighbours helped. “They collected some money and dry ration for me. I was managing Lavanya’s milk with that money. After the lockdown was extended, the neighbours too stopped helping and told me that they are unable to manage themselves,” he said.The milkman gave milk on credit for three days but refused to do so after the lockdown was extended. “I told him that I will pay once I am able to earn, but he refused,” lamented Deepak. The landlord was kind enough to defer the rent, but asked him to vacate on April 15. “I had fallen ill on March 21. A few days later, he asked me to leave saying that if something happened to me, he won’t be able to manage the situation. Also, there was no fan in the room,” he said.Helping handOn Tuesday, Deepak went to a friend’s house in Uttam Nagar to borrow money. But on his way back, at the barricade, police officers saw him with his daughter and asked him why he was there.“I told them everything. They told me that I could stay at the shelter till the lockdown ends and I get some work. They also dropped me here at the school,” he said.Praising the government school, he said: “Everything is good here. They also provide milk for my daughter. It is much better than sleeping without a fan,” added Deepak."

Many complained that despite the State government’s announcement, free ration was not being provided to those who did not have ration cards; others said that due to lack of cash in hand, they were unable to buy other raw material or procure gas cylinders and hence, depended on the cooked food being handed out at the distribution centres. “I have been out of work since the lockdown started and have a family of seven to feed. All our resources have been used up. We do not even have money to get other raw materials or a gas cylinder. How can we cook at home under such circumstances? The cooked food being provided at the distribution centre is our only hope,” said 60-year-old Ganesh Prasad, an e-rickshaw operator, for whom waiting in an hour-long queue twice a day has become routine.Options running outWaiting outside a municipal school in Govindpuri, Mohammad Altaf, a tailor, added: “I have been on the lookout for any kind of work but have found nothing. There is only a certain point till which we can ask others for help. Now even those options are running out.” A resident of a transit camp in the area, Altaf said, “When food is distributed, they give food for two people per family. But we have large families. So we take turns to stand in line and collect the cooked food. It takes time, but we have no other option.”Naresh Sharma, a carpenter who lives near Okhla Mandi, said, “I am from Bihar and don’t have a ration card in Delhi. I tried once to get ration and stood in line but the stock ran out by the time my turn came. I haven’t tried again and have been depending on the meals served by authorities.” Balli, a 55-year-old sanitation worker from Badarpur, said, “I have tried a multiple times to get ration without having a card but have been denied every time. They ask us to get a coupon and when we try to get that, it keeps showing that its being ‘processed’. How long can we wait? It’s best to have whatever we are being provided with in terms of the cooked meals.”For Radha Gupta, a resident of Madanpur Khadar, collecting ration has meant a 30-minute walk to the nearest school. The sole earner in a family of eight, Gupta, who work as a domestic help, said, “This is the first time I managed to collect the ration and I got my e-coupon a day ago. For the last few days, my children are sleeping almost hungry as all we could manage was one roti per person. I have not been able to collect my salary as the roads are blocked and I could not travel.”Accompanied by her 11-year-old daughter, Gupta said, “I do not know how to sustain the family and there is nobody supporting me. We do not even have basic essential items. How am I supposed to keep my children healthy in such a situation? Whom do I ask for help?”"
382,Delhi,"April 18, 2020 23:10 IST",National,NEW DELHI,Coronavirus lockdown | Airfare refund order will help only a few passengers,"The government order directing airlines to refund only those tickets that were booked during the lockdown period leaves out the vast majority of passengers who had booked tickets before the flights were banned. Such passengers will have to be content with credit notes issued by different airlines, though this violates the refund rules of the Directorate-General of Civil Aviation (DGCA).Also read | Refund fares to passengers, airlines toldAs large-scale flight cancellations became the norm in the days leading up to the ban on flights, airlines offered credit shells to passengers. SpiceJet says these will be valid till February 28, 2021, IndiGo’s credit notes can be redeemed until a year after they were issued and Vistara’s and GoAir’s till December 30.It may seem the money is safe with the airlines, but the fallout of the collapse of Jet Airways and Kingfisher Airways is still fresh in the minds of thousands of passengers who had lost their money paid for tickets on flights that never took off. The financial health of most Indian carriers today, except IndiGo, does not inspire much confidence.Also read | Air India opens bookings on select domestic routes from May 4, international from June 1The order issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation requires airlines to refund money within 30 days for tickets booked during the first lockdown period (March 25-April 14) for travel during the second lockdown period (April 15-May 3). Airlines themselves have said bookings during this short period were minuscule, which means this will benefit only a small number of passengers. By restricting its order to these dates, the government has essentially allowed airlines to deny passengers refunds for tickets booked before March 25, though it is a violation of the DGCA’s rules. The Civil Aviation Requirement (CAR) states, “The option of holding the refund amount in credit shell by the airlines shall be the prerogative of the passenger and not a default practice of the airline.” The government directive is flawed on several counts, including allowing the airlines 30 days after receiving a passenger’s request for a refund, when the CAR requires the airlines to refund on the same day in case of a cash transaction and seven days for credit card purchases. Only if a passenger booked a ticket on a travel portal could the airlines take 30 days. Moreover, there is no need for a passenger to request a refund because it is the duty of the airlines to start the process immediately after a flight cancellation.Aviation consultancy CAPA posted on Twitter on Friday: “The circular should clearly state that the DGCA is temporarily suspending — with the period of time to be defined — the provisions of the Civil Aviation Requirement on the refund of airline tickets (dated 22-May-2008), as well as the Passenger Charter of 2019. If these rights have been suspended due to emergency conditions prevailing, this should be formally notified by the DGCA.” Asked whether the government was likely to amend the CAR or suspend it temporarily to ensure that its order complied with the rules, a senior official said, “The CAR is for normal circumstances. What we are dealing with is an extraordinary situation. There is no need to issue an amendment. The DGCA is empowered to overrule regulations, if needed.” Again, the rules require that if a CAR is being amended, the DGCA must first issue a draft and put it out for consultation for 30 days."

But the report noted that the Yamuna has still not met the “water quality criteria”.Reduced pollutionAccording to the report, the pollution has reduced by 21% at ITO Bridge, 20% at Nizamuddin Bridge, and 18% at Okhla Barrage. Also, pollution has reduced in five out of the six major drains, which flow into the Yamuna, that the DPCC measured.A National Green Tribunal (NGT)-appointed monitoring committee had earlier this month asked the DPCC and the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) to measure the quality of water in the Yamuna.Water from HaryanaLast week, a report by the Delhi Jal Board (DJB) had also shown the quality of water has improved during the lockdown and DJB officials had said that it was also due to increased discharge of water from Haryana.On April 6, the DPCC had collected water samples from nine locations along the Yamuna and 20 locations of drains and compared the different parameters with values from April 2019.Of the nine locations of the river, an increase in pollution was observed only in Khajuri Paltoon Pool, according to the report. “In April 2019, the average flow was 1,000 cusecs compared to the average flow of 3,900 cusecs in April 2020. Therefore, the dilution is also contributing to the improvement of water quality,” the report noted.Of the nine locations from where the DPCC took samples, five have shown 18%-33% reduction in biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) levels. The rest of the four locations have shown slight to considerable increase in BOD levels.BOD is the amount of oxygen needed by microorganisms to decompose organic matter (waste or pollutants) under aerobic reaction (in the presence of oxygen).A higher BOD level means that more oxygen is needed to decompose a large quantity of organic matter (waste or pollutants) present in the water. So, a higher value of BOD means that the water is more polluted.Dissolved oxygen According to the report, four of the nine locations where dissolved oxygen (DO) was nil in 2019 showed DO levels of 2.3-4.8 mg/l. Dissolved oxygen is the amount of dissolved oxygen present in the water which is needed for aquatic life to survive. The quality of water increases with an increase in DO levels.A DO level of 5 mg/l or above is the recommended level for bathing in a river and DO levels over 5 mg/l were found only in two locations closer to where the river enters Delhi, as per the report."

But, with the strict coronavirus lockdown in place, many people have opted to delay immersion.“You can see this room is full of urns containing ashes. People are storing the ashes in an urn (or kalash) here so that they can do the immersion after the lockdown is lifted,” Dharminder, a pandit at the Lodhi Road shamshan, told The Hindu on Tuesday. “In many cases, the children [of the dead] are abroad and are unable to even perform cremation rites. And, with all flights non-operational, they are doing the next best thing by storing the ash-filled urns for future immersion,” Dharminder stated.He stands inside a small room with some urns stacked neatly and others placed on the ground as space runs out. All the urns are labelled with the name of the dead person and the address so that there is no chance of mishandling.Dharminder, who has been a pandit at the cremation ground for many years, said he has never seen such a situation before. “If this [lockdown] situation continues, we will have to find more space to store these urns,” he added.Cremations, too, have become small affairs at Lodhi Road.

The nation-wide lockdown that restricted people’s movement outdoors came into force on March 24 and was announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi with an objective to break the transmission of the deadly coronavirus. The 21-day lockdown was preceded by a day-long voluntary Janata curfew on March 2.  On April 14, Modi announced extension of the lockdown till May 3, as law enforcement agencies across in Gautam Buddh Nagar like elsewhere in the country got down to ensure stricter adherence to the guidelines that included action against those out on streets during the pandemic without a valid reason.  Between March 23 and April 22, 3,681 people were booked for violating the lockdown of which 3,219 got arrested and 944 FIRs were registered, the police data stated.

However, the evacuation trips did not come for free and they were not affordable either. Also read: Hundreds of foreign nationals fly back home in 30 rescue flightsWhile the U.S. nationals had to pay anywhere between $2,000-2500 per person from New Delhi to San Francisco or Mumbai to Atlanta, British nationals had to spend between £500-600 despite the U.K. government allocating £75 million to support special charter flights from countries where commercial flight operations were not available. However, the U.S. gave a loan option to its nationals and even took a promissory note allowing them to fly and pay later. The U.K. Government offered conditional loans that many could not avail while flying out of India. U.S. nationals were informed that if they failed to repay the loan, they would not be eligible for issue of new passport. Only U.S. citizens with confirmation with U.S. Mission to India were allowed to board the flights. Promissory note “Please understand this flight is not free. All passengers will need to reimburse the U.S. government for the cost of the flight. Previous flights have cost between $ 2,000 and 2,500 per person. A legal document, called a promissory note, for the full cost of the flight must be signed by each adult passenger before boarding. However, payment is not required at the time of the flight,” the U.S. Embassy in India said in a travel advisory to their nationals.Responding to an announcement put out on Twitter by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that U.K. travellers should return home and £75 million had been allocated to support special charter flights where commercial options were no longer available, an aspiring flyer replied wondering why people were being charged £600 from India if so much money was earmarked for the purpose. Another traveller said the tickets were “quite expensive” for one way and sought to know how he could avail the loan. However, he was informed that he should attempt to use his own financial means to arrange return to U.K..More than double “I had to pay £1088 for travel from Delhi to London for myself and my three-year-old daughter. This is more than double the normal fare... we usually pay £862 for return ticket on the same sector. We are British nationals and the U.K. Government should have considered some subsidy if not free repatriation,” said Neha Chauhan, a banking professional in London who took a British Airways flight from Delhi on April 21, 2020.Early this month, the U.K. government said that over 3,000 British travellers, including tourists, short term travellers and their direct dependents, currently stranded in India would get home on an additional 12 charter flights for which bookings opened on April 10, 2020. Travellers who could not afford the cost and had exhausted all other options available for getting funds were told to contact a commercial partner for seeking loan. “You may be eligible to apply for an emergency loan to cover the cost of the ticket. This is a last resort option and you would need to repay the loan when you are back in the U.K.,” the advisory said.Srikanth, an IT Director in a reputed firm in Washington DC and a native of Visakhapatnam, said the fare was almost thrice compared to the normal one way trip from Delhi to San Francisco or Mumbai to Atlanta, the sectors in which the rescue flights were operated. “Travellers were told to report to the nearest U.S. Consulate for a health check-up. This fare is much more than what is sold during peak holiday season. Many have opted to stay back hoping that international flights will resume soon after the lockdown in India,” he said.Many other countries including Australia, Japan and others operated special charter flights to move their nationals stranded in India home. The pricing details of those flights were not available for comparison though airport sources said that most of the rescue planes charged double since they would fly back empty."

410,Delhi,"April 23, 2020 23:53 IST",Delhi,NEW DELHI,Delhi pollution halved during first phase of lockdown: CPCB,"The first phase of the lockdown, from March 25 to April 15, reduced particulate matter pollution by nearly half in Delhi, according to a report by the Central Pollution Control Board. “Overall, 46% reduction in PM2.5 and 50% reduction in PM10 was observed during the lockdown period,” the body noted.This led to nearly a week-long run of the air quality index remaining in the ‘good’ and ‘satisfactory’ categories, as opposed to the unhealthy and hazardous categories the city is more accustomed to. The stint was broken by a dust storm and subsequent change in temperature and dry weather heralding summer.The improvement in air was due to a reduction in combustion and industrial sources which are common to both the categories of particulate matter. As 81% of Delhi’s nitrous oxide emissions came from the transport sector, restrictions on vehicular activity led to a 56% reduction in NO2 levels and over 37% reduction in carbon monoxide levels during the lockdown period, compared to pre-lockdown times.There was also a 47% reduction in benzene levels while sulphur dioxide levels reduced only by 20%. This was because 70% of Delhi’s SO2 originates from power plants located around Delhi and power plants continue to operate. Other sources of SO2 were restaurants and some industries, which were operational during the lockdown period along with biomass/refuse burning in some areas in and around Delhi.Less than average Moreover, 24-hourly average PM2.5 and PM10 were within National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for 20 and 15 days respectively, while NO2 levels were 75% less than their 24-hourly standard. Also, 24 hourly average levels of PM10, PM2.5 , NO2 and SO2 dropped as low as 24 g/m3, 39g/m3, 15 g/m3 and 10 g/m3 respectively, the report noted.While significant reduction in NO2 levels was observed in Noida (68%), Ghaziabad (60%) and Gurugram (40%), the same was not observed in Faridabad (17%), where NO2 emissions were found higher during a few days during lockdown. This was likely due to the gas-based power plants in and around Faridabad. Significant reduction in SO2 levels was only seen in Faridabad (47%) and Ghaziabad (22%), while Gurugram (14%) and Noida (10%) recorded relatively limited reductions during the lockdown phase.As much as 78% of cities in the country that are monitored by the CPCB had their AQI in the good and satisfactory categories, increasing from the average of 44% seen in the pre-lockdown phase."

Also UTPs who are foreign nationals are excluded from this relaxation.Those convicts who have completed their sentence and could not be released for want of deposit of fine have been given the option to deposit it within “15 days of lifting of lockdown”.DG (Prisons) also assured the committee that before releasing any prisoner, he or she will be medically screened and their transportation will be carried out in full compliance of the norms of social distancing."

Fans should be used to increase air movement, the guidelines say and add that exhaust fans in kitchens and toilets should also be switched on.Also read: Novel coronavirus can be transmitted even before symptoms show upIn case of buildings that don’t have adequate fresh air, the guidelines say, an additional fresh air duct should be provided.The guidelines also highlight the need for sanitisation and maintenance of HVAC systems once the lockdown ends.“Most commercial establishments have remained closed during the lockdown. These establishments will need maintenance for both engineering and health safety. The air-conditioned spaces of establishments under prolonged lockdown will pose health hazards due to fungus and molds in the ducts and open spaces depending on the humidity and temperature prevailing within,” the guidelines say."

418,Delhi,"April 27, 2020 23:09 IST",Delhi,New Delhi,Families worried as riot-related arrests could lead to contracting COVID-19,"Many families in riot-hit areas of north-east Delhi fear that those arrested by the police during the nation-wide lockdown could contract COVID-19 while in jail.“The lockdown is not for the police. It is for us. Who knows one of them has the virus. If we tell them this, they warn us not to teach them the law,” said Farhan, a software engineer living in Chand Bagh. He had not seen his brother since the police took him for questioning on March 31.Mr. Farhan said his brother is a mechanical engineering student and was taking coaching classes in Mukherjee Nagar for government services.“The police took my brother without any notice. Later, we came to know that he was arrested as he was featured in a video,” said Mr. Farhan, adding that the irony is that the video is from outside our house and was taken on March 23 when there was no violence.After the arrest, he was sent to Mandoli Jail. Due to the lockdown, we have no way of knowing how he is, said Mr. Farhan.Similar storyIn adjoining Bhajanpura, 21-year-old Mehnaz had a similar story to tell. “They [police] took him on the pretext of asking some questions and we have not seen him since then,” said Mehnaz.When the police visited the residence, her brother, who is working as a welder, had gone out to buy medicines. “He has seizures,” said Mehnaz.“The next day (on April 11), my brother went to the police station around 11 a.m. When he did not return till 7 p.m., we went to the station and were told that my brother will not be released as he was spotted on the riots video,” she said.Mehnaz said she is worried about the well-being of her brother inside jail, more so in view of the ongoing pandemic, as he had received bullet wound on his back during the riots and has other medical conditions too.Asif, a resident of Chaman Park, said he has not been able to meet his son who was arrested in connection with the riots in early March due to the lockdown.He added that others too from his locality are being arrested during the lockdown period. “Most of us don’t know what is happening,” he lamented.‘Abrogation of rights’Lawyers providing legal assistance to the riot-hit worry that investigations are on without giving due regard to the health, safety and fundamental rights of the persons concerned. They said the ongoing police actions pose a significant risk to the health of the affected individuals, their families and the public at large in light of the pandemic.“There has been a complete abrogation of the fundamental rights of the persons concerned as they are unable to avail of the rights that accrue at the stage of summoning, detention, arrest and remand due to the shutdown of courts and unavailability of lawyers,” they said. Advocates Seema Misra, Sowjhanya Shankaran, Maneka Khanna and Nitika Khaitan had made a representation before a State-level High Powered Committee (HPC), formed pursuant to the Supreme Court direction to decongest prisons due to the COVID-19 outbreak.In their letter, they highlighted that during the lockdown, investigating agencies have summoned several persons to appear at police stations. “We are aware of at least five such cases from localities in north-east Delhi,” the advocates said.They said many of these summonses note that failure to comply with it would render the person liable for criminal action. However, as per the March 24 lockdown order, ordinary residents and citizens are permitted to step out only for essential supplies such as groceries and medicines, the lawyers argued. “In trying to comply with such summons, its recipients render themselves liable to penal action for violating lockdown orders, and in failing to comply with the summons, they may be liable for penal action,” the lawyers said.They also said that people have been directed to appear at Crime Branch or Special Cell police stations that are at a considerable distance from their homes, making it extremely difficult for them.In many cases, the police are detaining people from their homes and neighbourhoods without any notice or information on the grounds of detention and without informing their family members , they alleged. “Moreover, there has been a troubling pattern of the police picking up family members of the person they seek to arrest as proxies and detaining them for hours on end to threaten and coerce such families to produce the person they seek to arrest,” the lawyer said.They also brought up the issue of police not providing a copy of the FIR.The HPC on April 18 declined to act on the letter saying, “the members of the committee are of the considered opinion that the submissions advanced in the representation and prayers made therein, are beyond the scope and purview of this committee”.Advocate Khaitan said a similar letter highlighting the above issues has been sent to the High Court for its consideration and the response is awaited."

Around 300 Tablighis, responding to an appeal by their leader Maulana Saad, have volunteered to save the lives of others battling the infection.Over the weekend, some of the men who were in quarantine in Narela and Sultanpuri went to donate blood plasma. Among them were Tablighis from Chennai, Mumbai, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh who had come to the Capital to attend events in Nizamuddin but found themselves stranded after the declaration of lockdown.“I had come from Chennai to attend a jod (meeting) at Markaz [the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Nizamuddin] on March 21 and was supposed to leave by Tamil Nadu Express on March 24. Then the Prime Minister declared a lockdown. Like so many others, I was stranded at the centre. On March 30 evening, I was shifted to Rajiv Gandhi hospital and released on April 19,” said 42-year-old Farooq Basha. Two days later, Basha got to know about blood plasma therapy. “Allah saved my life. Now, I want to save others. It does not matter that we do not know the person who will benefit. At the end of the day, it is about humanity. I hope it will help improve the image of the Tablighi Jamaat in the mind of the common man,” he said, referring to the negative coverage the group received in several sections of the media because of a cluster of cases emanating from the Nizamuddin centre.Also read: The story of India’s largest COVID-19 clusterIncidentally, Basha went to donate plasma after a day of fasting. “Three other men from our Tamil Nadu group have donated plasma. Our first COVID-19 report was positive, the subsequent two were negative,” he said.Basha’s colleague Abdul Rehman had done likewise last Friday. The 45-year-old was under quarantine for almost a month — two weeks in a hospital, then another 17 days at home.“I have been associated with Tablighi Jamaat for many years. I attend ijtema(congregations) at many places. After getting to know about plasma therapy, I consulted my family about donating,” he said. Did he think of his own health? “What was there to worry? I am 45 and fit. I am a salesman and don’t feel any weakness. I just wanted to help the needy,” said Rehman.Following the example of Basha and Rehman, 52-year-old Sabir Ali of Bihar too went to donate plasma. He, however, refrained from speaking to the media, saying, “It is all between Allah and me. In our religion, if you give charity with one hand, the second hand should not know. So, I do not want to talk about it.”Earlier, on April 21, Maulana Saad had asked Tabligh men who had recovered to come forward to donate plasma. “Most of our brothers who were in quarantine tested negative. They have all recovered. Those who tested positive are recovering too. I request all of them to come forward and donate blood plasma,” he had said."

Tracking news reports in English and Hindi primarily, as well as in regional languages such as Kannada, Telugu and Tamil, the group found that 310 deaths had occurred from March 19 — when an auto-rickshaw driver in Bengaluru died by suicide owing to financial distress — till Saturday.“News reports tracked during the ongoing lockdown suggest that more than 300 people died because of the lockdown: as a result of hunger, financial distress and exhaustion, due to police atrocities for lockdown violations, and inability to get timely medical attention. There have been a staggering number of suicides as well, caused by fear of infection, loneliness, lack of freedom of movement, and alcohol withdrawal during the lockdown,” the group of activists and academics said in a release. Among the deaths connected to the pandemic but non-virus related, 34 were due to starvation and financial distress, including the inability to sell farm produce; 20 were caused by exhaustion, including while walking long distances to reach their homes or standing in lines for ration; and 73 were from suicides due to fear of testing positive for the novel coronavirus and fear of loneliness. Aman, an assistant professor of legal practice at Jindal Global School of Law, who is part of the project, along with researcher and Ph.D scholar Kanika, said the aim of the tracker was to keep these deaths in public memory. “These deaths should be counted while assessing the success or failure of the lockdown,” he said. Thejesh G.N., a Bengaluru-based engineer on whose website thejeshgn.com the tracker can be found, said the real numbers would be higher as the tracker could not capture all the news reports of such deaths in the country, and news organisations would not be able to report on every such incident. “Our goal is to put a spotlight on these deaths.

Look at trusted news sources to verify whether the story is being reported elsewhere. When a story is reported in multiple places, it is more likely to be true,” the manual said, asking the officers to read beyond “outrageous” headlines designed to attract clicks. It asked them to read the whole story and also do a “quick search on the author” if he or she is “reliable and real.”Also read: Coronavirus | Centre asks social media firms to remove false news on COVID-19“The extensive spread of fake news has the potential to gravely impact individuals as well as the society at large.

The survey gains significance in light of a recent notification from the university’s Dean of Examinations inviting suggestions and comments on holding examinations in the present academic year.With regard to availability of smartphones or computers, up to 62.6% of the students surveyed said that they did, however, nearly 72.2% of these students said that they had connectivity issues as a consequence of which they could not attend online classes. Apart from this, 11.6% said they couldn’t attend classes due to financial incapability and 7.6% said they were facing difficulties due to household chores.Study materialAmong those surveyed, 44.4% said that the college or department was undertaking online classes while 37.7% said that only some classes were being taken. Most students, however, said that only a few teachers were providing study material with nearly 23.4% saying that they weren’t provided study material in the language of the examination.

491,Delhi,"May 13, 2020 00:05 IST",Delhi,New Delhi,"Train services resume, but not all happy as many are left stranded","A group of anxious migrant labourers stood outside the New Delhi railway station hoping to hitch a ride back to their home town in one of the passenger trains, as select services resumed on Tuesday. Their anxiety turned into grief when they saw shut ticket counters, and later, informed that the tickets were sold online and the police were letting only those with valid e-tickets to enter the station. And even if they found some means to purchase tickets online, they couldn’t afford the price. Some had walked 85 km, some had spent the entire night on the station premises, some had come with parents and children, some had come from various States, but their hopes were shattered. Like Brajesh Kumar and Ram Paswan, aged 22 and 23 respectively, walked 14 hours, from Shahid Bhagat Singh Chowk in Rewari, Haryana, to reach the station. “We had no money to hire a taxi. Now, we are told that the ticket prices are over ₹1,500 per head. How will we get that money,” asked the duo, who were working at a local factory, which shut after the nationwide lockdown “Our only option is to head back to our home town in Bihar’s Gidha is on foot,” said Kumar. In sheer desperation, he is asking people for the road that leads to his district. With the option of returning to Rewari ruled down, they decided to spend the night at a shelter in the station premises.A group of Gorakhpur-bound painters — Prince Raj Prajapati (19), Shahbuddin (20), Dil Sher (20) and Sahil Raja (20) — thought they could manage some discount on the tickets, only to be turned away by the police. “We hoped the police will help us get into a train. But that is not happening. We don’t know what we are going to do now,” said Prajapati.No app, no entryMohammed Saddam Hussain (30), his wife and their one-and-a-half-year-old baby were calmly waiting for their turn to enter the railway station when someone asked if he had installed Aarogya Setu app on his mobile. The Indian Railways had made it mandatory for passengers travelling in 15 special trains. “We don’t now what it is. We have the online ticket. Is that not enough?” Hussain queried, before he frantically sought help to install the application. Fellow construction worker Mohammad Tanvir, who was to board the train for Katihar in Bihar, too encountered a similar problem. Till 7.30 p.m. on Monday, more than 18,000 tickets were booked online.‘Don’t bring back Corona’Twenty-three-year-old Sapna Thakur, who landed in Delhi from Jhansi on March 19 for a job interview in an IT firm, said she has been stuck in the Capital with her roommate since March 23. The interview did not go well either, as the firm told her that they had frozen the recruitment. Thanks to her mother, she was informed about online ticketing and the Aarogya Setu app. “She keeps a tab on the news for me since I have been living in a ‘red zone’ for the last two months,” Ms. Thakur said. “Now that I am returning home, my mother quipped ‘Corona lekar mat aana’ [don’t bring back corona],” she joked. But those standing outside the station were in no mood to joke."
492,Delhi,"May 13, 2020 12:17 IST",National,NEW DELHI,"COVID-19 lockdown: April job losses highest among youth, says data","Job losses during the lockdown have been disproportionately high among younger Indians, with six crore people between the ages of 20 and 39 losing jobs in April, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE).The wider employment situation has shown some improvement in the last week, on the back of a pick-up in agricultural activity and the re-opening of businesses in rural India. The week ended May 10 recorded a jobless rate of 24% in comparison to a record high of 27% the previous week. Urban unemployment stood at almost 28%, while it was 22.3% in rural areas. However, the demographics of job loss are a major cause of concern.More than 2.7 crore young people in their 20s lost their jobs last month, along with 3.3 crore people in their 30s, said CMIE managing director and chief executive Mahesh Vyas.‘Long-term repercussions’“This has serious long-term repercussions. It is during this age that young India builds its career in the hope of a bright future,” he said. “If the career of this cohort is disrupted or postponed by even a year it will have to compete with the new cohorts joining the labour force after them — arguably, for fewer jobs. Young India will not be able to build the savings it will require later in life.”Young aspiring Indians in the age group of 20-24 years accounted for 8.5% of total employed people in the country in 2019-20, but 11% of those lost jobs. Most of these young people have just entered the labour markets, and 3.4 crore of them were working in the last financial year. Only 2.1 crore still had jobs in April.Debt delinquency likelyThese job losses could raise debt delinquency and impact household savings, said Mr. Vyas. “While households may well conserve cash during these times, the loss of jobs among the young deprives households of the extra cash that is mostly saved for either buying a house or durables or for retirement,” he added.Noting that 12 crore jobs had been lost because of the lockdown, Mr. Vyas said the window of the benefit of doubt in favour of a lockdown was closing. “Claims that the pandemic can be devastating is countered by the fact that the lockdown is already devastating,” he said, adding that the government’s dithering over a fiscal package meant that unlike in the United States where the state provided assistance to the jobless, Indians could not afford to remain unemployed."
493,Delhi,"May 13, 2020 04:47 IST",National,NEW DELHI,"CBI alerts Centre, State agencies to possibilty of drug trafficking","The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has alerted Central and State agencies to the possibility of international traffickers concealing illegal drug consignments in the cargo of COVID-19 protective equipment to evade detection. The alert has been sounded on the basis of inputs from the Interpol.“The Interpol inputs are about drug traffickers taking advantage of the global pandemic due to the COVID-19 outbreak,” an official said. Among the Central enforcement agencies, the Narcotics Control Bureau, the Directorate of Revenue Intelligence and the Customs have the mandate to seize illegal narcotics and drugs. The Enforcement Directorate is empowered to probe the money-laundering aspect.Security forces deployed along the international borders and coasts, including those of the Coast Guard, the Border Security Force, the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and the Sashastra Seema Bal, often intercept illicit drug consignments. In the States and the Union Territories, the police have dedicated units for operations against drug-trafficking syndicates.“The international drug-traffickers, particularly those from Pakistan, have of late been using the sea route. Therefore, it is necessary to intensify patrolling in high seas, and for that, more high-speed interceptor boats should be deployed,” said a government official.According to a Union Home Ministry reply in the Lok Sabha in December last, there was no proposal to create a Central security force for the high-level security of coasts. The Ministry said it was implementing the coastal security scheme in phases for strengthening the infrastructure of the coastal police force for patrolling and surveillance of coastal areas, especially shallow waters close to the coast. Phase-I of the scheme was implemented during 2005-2011; based on a vulnerability/gap analysis, Phase-II was formulated for implementation from April 2011 to March 2020.The scheme provided for 204 coastal police stations, 429 boats, 60 jetties, 284 four-wheelers, 554 two-wheelers, 97 checkpoints, 58 outposts and 30 barracks, along with navigation/communication equipment, card-readers, equipment that enhances night operation capabilities of boats and computer systems and allied equipment in the coastal States and Union Territories on an outlay of ₹2,226 crore.The Interpol has also issued a warning that criminal organisations are using food delivery services to smuggle drugs and other illicit goods during the global lockdown. It received reports from the police in Ireland, Malaysia, Spain and the United Kingdom about delivery drivers transporting drugs, including cocaine, marijuana, ketamine and ecstasy.“In early April, the Spanish national police identified and arrested seven individuals dressed as food delivery drivers in Alicante and Valencia. They were caught delivering cocaine and marijuana by cycle, motorcycle and car — some of the drugs had been concealed in a false bottom of home delivery backpacks,” said the Interpol.In Ireland, the Gardai officers seized 8 kg of cocaine and two handguns hidden in pizza boxes. In Malaysia, a case emerged of a legitimate food delivery driver having been used as an unwitting drug mule.“Based on these arrests, as well as incidents in other countries, the Interpol issued a ‘purple notice’ alerting its 194 member countries to this new modus operandi,” said the Interpol."

Vikas Kumar, a civil engineer working in Kolkata, reached the city at around 11 a.m. only to be welcomed by an empty parking lot, sans autos and taxis. His journey was only half way through, as he was Karnal-bound. “It has been three hours already and I have been waiting here, trying to arrange for a cab that will take me to Karnal. Who knew there won’t be any arrangement? Some of the co-passengers had private vehicles pick them up. But for people like me who has a long distance to cover, that is not an option,” he said. For 21-year-old Shivnandan Kumar, the wait was longer, as he did not have the means or requisite information to board the special train to Patna. “I had gone to Mathura just before the lockdown to drop my sister at her in-laws’ place and got stuck there. I took a truck from there and reached Delhi in the afternoon to take a train back home. But the police did not let me enter as I did not have a ticket. I am penniless right now and do not know how to book an online ticket,” he said. “Everything is shut here and I have not been able to arrange even food. How do I go back?” asked the man from Bhagalpur. Long waitEven as hundreds got to make their journey back to their home States, several labourers, with no resources to buy tickets for the special trains, continued their wait outside the station. Jitender Sahni, who hails from Samastipur district in Bihar, has been outside the New Delhi station’s Paharganj entrance for three days. Camping under a tree with his wife and two children, he said that despite being close to the station, their wait for the train was turning out to be “endless.” “We want to go back but we cannot afford the tickets. Every time we try to approach the entrance, police personnel send us back, stating that only those with tickets can enter. Where will we get ₹5,000 for the tickets? We have walked from Faridabad, over two days, and reached the station with the hope we can return. It seems nobody cares about us,” said Sahni, a daily wager. Sitting next to the Sahni family, Rajendra Swain, from Odisha’s Cuttack district, added: “There have been several people who have been coming throughout the day and asking for details. These children have been lying on the sidewalk for three days. Even though I have arranged for a ticket for Friday’s train, I will probably have to spend the night under this tree itself.”"

514,Karnataka,"May 06, 2020 20:28 IST",Bengaluru,India,COVID-19: ‘We have built so many houses. Can’t we just go back to our homes?’,"The Karnataka government’s decision to cancel trains to prevent migrant labourers from leaving Bengaluru has sown seeds of distrust and anger among those who want to go back to their native towns. Tension was brewing at a labour camp of over 700 construction workers at the site of an upcoming apartment complex in Konanakunte Cross on Wednesday. Hundreds of people had packed their bags and gathered at the gates waiting to return home, but were not allowed to leave by private security guards. The labourers wanted no part in the government’s attempt to kickstart economic activity. As their anger and frustration mounted, they started shouting slogans: “We won't work, let us go home”.The crowd eventually spilled out onto the streets, and the police had a tough time ‘pushing them in’, as a senior officer put it. “This is a ticking bomb. We do not know for how long we can manage them. Going home is an emotional issue, not just an economic one,” said a senior police official from one of the outer zones, which has a large concentration of labour camps. Across the State, as many as 2.13 lakh migrant labourers, a majority from Odisha and Bihar, registered on the Seva Sindhu online platform to return home, said sources. However, just over 8,000 labourers were able to leave on eight trains before services were cancelled. Ravindra Ram, 32, from Jharkhand, was one of the hundreds gathered at the gates of the labour camp in Konanakunte Cross with his luggage. When informed that trains were cancelled, the workers refused to believe the representatives of the contractors. “Two of my friends had boarded a train on Tuesday. I did a video call with them while they were on the train,” he said. Pointing to a 31-storey apartment complex he helped build, Ravindra Ram said, “We have built so many houses. Can’t we just go back to our home?” Despite politicians claiming otherwise, labourers say their living conditions are pathetic. “We were given rice and potatoes, and ₹200 per week, which was stopped two days ago. Now we have been asked to resume work,” said Imran Khan, 42, from Bihar.He alleged that the contractors have informed that the money will be cut from their wages. “We have been told to begin work, or we won’t be allowed to live in the shed. They are treating us like slaves. We won’t resume work and want to go home,” he said. Labourers throng police stationsMany police personnel were not aware of the government’s decision to cancel trains, which led to further confusion. Hundreds of labourers from Garudacharpalya turned up at Mahadevapura Police Station on Wednesday morning, wanting to register on Seva Sindhu. Gulab Mandal, a labourer at Garudacharpalya, said there were over 1,600 labourers in the camp where is based. Caning at AnchepalyaIn another instance, a group of labourers from Dabaspet went to Bengaluru International Exhibition Centre (BIEC) where the government had housed those wanting to board trains. On finding that the camp has been disbanded, they proceeded to Majestic on Tuesday night in search of a train. They police made them walk back to their camp near Dabaspet. They were picked up by a bus midway and housed in a ground in Anchepalya for the night. On Wednesday morning, they had an altercation with the police. “The police resorted to caning to control the situation,” said a police officer. Suresh Hari, chairman, CREDAI-Bengaluru, said builders need to reach out to their labourers, give them emotional support and convince them it is better to go home after normalcy returns. “If they go home now, they will be stuck in their villages without work or pay. With lockdown, they may not be able to return soon. Work is restarting here. They can earn some money and go home after a few weeks,” he said. However, police officials are bracing themselves for more trouble. “Many of the people who have registered to return home are neither construction labourers nor live in labour camps. They live in small rented accommodation and hostels. They work in malls or as security guards. None of the business establishments are open yet. At the same time, they have been denied a chance to go home. It is tough to manage crowds comprising such people,” a senior police official said.Walking to Uttar PradeshSmall groups of migrants have begun an arduous journey back to their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh on foot. Byatarayanapura MLA Krishna Byre Gowda spotted some of them near Devanahalli on Wednesday afternoon and posted a video of his interaction with them on Twitter. One of the labourers making the journey said that they decided to make the journey on foot as they had neither food nor work in the city, and that trains were cancelled. “This is inhuman. They are so disturbed as to walk home. Some may die,” said Mr. Krishna Byre Gowda in a tweet."

However, he admitted that the facilities were being overwhelmed by the number of people in need.The civic body is also taking help from NGOs like Centre for Urban and Rural Development Society. But will it be enough? “More temporary shelters are necessary,” said several officials. ‘Overcrowding is a health hazard’Activists and NGOs are worried about the lack of monitoring, given that people are living in such close quarters. If even one person is a carrier of the novel coronavirus, others will be exposed. “Health officials talk about social distancing, but it’s not possible here,” said S.S. Rajani, who has worked with the homeless. Officials admit that they cannot maintain social distancing. “We have maintained cleanliness and are providing good food. We conduct medical checks also. More temporary shelter homes are necessary at such times,” said one senior civic official. Several social welfare organisations and NGOs have come together to help out. Anand Murthy, who manages the BBMP’s shelter in Upparpete, said the civic body has been providing food packets to residents. “A few NGOs have donated biscuit packets, bottled water, coffee and fruits,” he said.In December 2018, the BBMP, with assistance from Impact India, an NGO, undertook a survey of the homeless in the eight zones. In the three core zones, nearly 4,000 homeless were found. This number, which has risen over the years, did not include families living by in small tarpaulin tents along roads. For instance, around 30 families have been selling pottery on the street between ITI Gate and K.R. Puram government hospital for decades. They live in tents by the road and have been bearing the brunt of the lockdown. “The last time we ate was Monday afternoon. We are waiting for someone to give us food. The children have not been fed. There is no milk,” said Angoori Bayi, a labourer from Rajasthan, who lives in the area."

But the lockdown has hit the newspaper distribution chain hard. Multiple vendors across the city told The Hindu that though newspapers are being printed, distribution had reduced by more than half. Roadside newspaper stalls, general shops that procure papers, libraries, schools and colleges have all been shut, affecting a major chunk of their business and distribution network.Many apartments and societies have refused to buy newspapers and others are not letting vendors inside for any delivery, affecting a major chunk of the business. “This is due to the rumour that newspapers could be carriers of the novel coronavirus. What they do not understand is that if newspapers can spread the virus, then even milk packets or online food delivery packets are also not safe,” said Nagesh K., a newspaper vendor in Whitefield, the frustration evident in his voice.According to G. Varadhan, president of Whitefield Newspaper Vendors’ Association, due to the lockdown, the income of vendors will fall by at least 55-60%. “Earlier, during bandhs or other such situations, the circulation of newspapers would always be regular and normal. However, this time, due to the intensity of fear, newspaper circulation has taken a massive beating,” he said.Vendors also say they were not able to deliver newspapers because of the restrictions. “The police are always sceptical and sometimes ask for passes. We do not have any identity cards also. However, the situation is getting better now,” G.S. Prakash, a newspaper delivery boy in Tin Factory on Old Madras Road, said.Despite paranoia and restrictions, newspaper vendors and agents say they are trying to deliver newspapers to homes wherever possible. “To quash such rumours, many newspapers clarified that the virus doesn’t transmit through newspapers. Even government and scientific bodies have dismissed it,” Mr. Nagesh said.Many agents across the city, including those Vidyaranyapuram, K.R. Puram, Whitefield, Mahadevapura, Kengeri, Banashankari stopped the supply of newspapers from March 25, but some resumed distribution from April 1. “Commission is the only profit we get. Since there are no signs of the situation getting better anytime soon, we do not know for how long we will need to suffer,” Mr. Varadhan said.As the newspaper distribution chain is categorised as essential service, vendors and newspaper agents have been demanding that they be given insurance and short-term financial assistance by the government or the industry."

In a mailer sent out by an apartment association, the residents were asked to stay indoors. Security personnel had been instructed to not even let in housekeeping or help staff, besides allowing exit of residents only in cases of emergency.Some hotels were open for delivery on the various food delivery apps. That apart, some e-commerce delivery personnel were seen making their deliveries. According to a delivery personnel from ekart, it was just another working day for them. “Many apartments have restrictions. We have been instructed to leave packages with the reception.

The equipment would shortly be imported from abroad. There is no dearth of funds to deal with the deadly disease,” the Minister said at a meeting of key district-level officers that he convened in Ballari on Thursday to discuss the measures taken to handle COVID-19. He directed the district administration to provide all facilities and equipment to Vijayanagar Institute of Medical Sciences (VIMS) and Trauma Care Centre that have been designated for COVID-19 treatment in the district. “Fortunately, we have thus for no COVID-19 positive cases in the district. We may have some in future and we should be prepared to handle the situation. The hospitals that are designated for COVID-19 treatment should be provided with all the required facilities and equipment,” he said. Anticipating the exponential increase in the number of COVID-19 positive cases in the State, Mr. Sriramulu appealed to private healthcare providers to join hands with the government to curb the menace. “I have heard that some of the private hospitals are downing their shutters on some pretext or the other. It is not correct. All private hospitals should compulsorily remain open during this crisis time and offer treatment as and when required,” he said.Arun and B.K.S. Sundar, doctors and office-bearers of Indian Medical Association’s district chapter, made it clear that their organisation was with the government in its fight against COVID-19. Responding to the Minister’s query on the implementation of the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Deputy Commissioner S.S. Nakul said that the Jindal Steel plant had downsised its workforce from 35,396 to 16,850 for observing the lockdown. “Apart from taking a slew of measures to prevent the COVID-19 from spreading, we have formed 28 rapid response squads and 17 various committees to handle the situation,” Mr. Nakul said. Legislators G. Somashekhar Reddy, K.C. Kondaiah, Allam Veerabhadrappa, Nagendra, Somalingappa and Superintendent of Police C.K. Baba and others were present. The people’s representatives and officers maintained social distancing by keeping two chairs vacant between them during the meeting. Later, the Health Minister visited an isolation ward established at VIMS and tried to instil confidence in patients there. “Don’t worry. Don’t lose your confidence. We hope that your report will be negative for COVID-19. Since you have developed some symptoms, you are kept here. We are with you.

We are firm on this and are sending such ambulances back,” the Minister said.He said transportation of essential goods and commodities between the two States had not been banned.The government was releasing the addresses of all those under home quarantine in the district to ensure public vigil, Mr. Poojary said, and added that it was never intended to ostracise such people. Defending the city police for circulating their list on social media, Mr. Poojary said it had been done to ensure that those under home quarantine followed norms strictly.Objecting to the State government decision, Muneer Katipalla, State president, Democratic Youth Federation of India, told The Hindu that several patients from north Kerala come to Mangaluru for medical treatment. Denying medical services to them in the guise of preventing COVID-19 is not proper. Those patients prefer hospitals and doctors who have been treating them for long in Mangaluru than approaching new doctors and hospitals. “It is an injustice,” he said.Closing the Karnataka–Kerala border road at Ishwaramangala in Puttur taluk by pouring mud on the road was an “inhuman” and “uncivilised” act. Instead, barricades could have been used. In case if there was any emergency how to remove the loads of mud dumped on the road, he questioned.Responding to reports on the issue, Mr. Poojary told reporters that all such blockades would be removed."

Sudhakar and Health and Family Welfare Minister B. Sriramulu on issues related to COVID-19, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa on Tuesday relieved the latter from handling all matters relating to the pandemic. He will continue to hold the Health and Family Welfare portfolio excluding Medical Education and matters relating to COVID-19, stated a notification issued by Governor Vajubhai R. Vala on Tuesday. Mr. Sriramulu has been given the additional responsibility of Backward Classes Welfare Department. Dr. Sudhakar, who has been mainly handling all matters relating to COVID-19 ever since the pandemic was reported in India, has been entrusted with Medical Education along with all matters relating to COVID-19 from the Health and Family Welfare Department.The Chief Minister, who denied that there was lack of coordination between the two Ministers, said his entire Ministry had been working in unison to flatten the curve of COVID-19. “While Mr. Sriramulu will tour the entire State, we want Dr. Sudhakar to focus on the city. There will be no clash between the two,” the Chief Minister said.However, sources said the decision was taken as Dr. Sudhakar, who is a doctor himself, had been handling COVID-19 situation “efficiently” in the State. From day one, Dr. Sudhakar has taken over the responsibility of coordinating with hospitals, setting up quarantine centres, briefing the press while also updating the status of positive cases on social media. All this while Mr. Sriramulu was busy with his daughter’s wedding. Although Mr. Sriramulu tweeted a few times on new cases and attended a few press conferences related to COVID-19, he never took over the entire responsibility.Sources in the Health Department said this new arrangement would affect the smooth functioning of the department. “The entire official machinery of the Health Department, including top officials, are involved in tackling COVID-19. Now, if the Minister has to be kept out of this important issue, we are afraid there will be administrative issues,” said an official.He said there was a possibility of further confusion in administrative matters, especially when several designated isolation facilities are in hospitals run by the Health Department."

About 20,000 hotel rooms will be taken to establish quarantine facilities,” the Deputy Chief Minister said. Fever clinicsHe said that fever clinics would be established so that people need not crowd hospitals directly and hospitalisation would be based on referrals.

Using the forced holiday, a group of artistes near Mangaluru have shot a Yakshagana performance on COVID-19 and have uploaded the video on social media to create awareness.The artistes, under the banner Siribagilu Venkappaiah Samskritika Prathisthana (Siribagilu Venkappaiah Cultural Foundation), Kasaragod, uploaded the 57-minute production on March 22, the day of ‘janata curfew’.The video ‘corona jagruthi yakshagana’ got more than 25,000 views by March 24 on YouTube, said Siribagilu Ramakrishna Mayya, ‘bhagawatha’ (singer-cum-director) of the troupe, to The Hindu. Incidentally, Mr. Mayya is also the ‘bhagawatha’ with Dharmasthala Manjunatheswara Krupaposhitha Yakshagana Mandali, a professional Yakshagana touring troupe well over 100 years old which is among 40 odd touring troupes that have been forced to stop their performances now due to Corona scare.The plotThe performance has used a puranic character ‘Dhanvantari’ to make the fictitious ‘coronasura’ (a villain) to run away from the battle field in India, thus ending the performance. Unlike in many conventional Yakshagana performances in which a spiritual force kills an evil force, here the spiritual force (Dhanvantari) does not kill the evil force but makes it flee. Using the role of a student returned from abroad, the show highlights how the student who fails to stick to home quarantine, tests positive for COVID-19 and spreads it to others. When the disease takes the turn of an epidemic, the people approach the King who in turn approaches the Dhanvantari who fights the villain. Well-known professional artistes Permude Jayaparakash Shetty, Madhuru Radhakrishna Navada, and Madhuru Vasudeva Ranga Bhat have played the key roles. A team of about 20 members have produced the show.M.A. Hegde, chairman, Karnataka Yakshagana Academy, poet Sridhara D.S., and Mr. Mayya wrote the songs. Ganesha Kalavrunda Paivalike arranged the costumes. None of the participants took any remuneration for the production, said Mr. Mayya.

Nearly 900 persons had returned from foreign countries to Udupi district since February.Already notices had been stuck on the walls of the houses of such persons and their neighbours had been told to keep a watch on their movements. This measure had been taken after the administration received several complaints of people under quarantine coming out of their houses and roaming about openly. If anybody found that a person under quarantine was wandering about openly, they could inform the police control room by calling Ph: 100 or the toll-free number, 1077, he said. Mr. Jagadeesha said that daily groceries and vegetables would be available for people to buy. Citizens should not roam around unnecessarily on the streets. They should come out only to purchase essential commodities. The administration would take stern action if anybody tried to create artificial scarcity of fruits and vegetables and increase their prices. The goods vehicles transporting vegetables and other grocery items from other districts would be allowed into the district only after checking the health of their drivers, he said. Vegetable and grocery shopkeepers should keep a distance of six feet between them and their customers. Hotels should only provide takeaways and seal the sitting areas on their premises, he said. So far, there had been no COVID-19 positive case in the district. If such a case got recorded, then the entire District Government Hospital here would be converted into COVID-19 Hospital. A temporary isolation ward of 150 beds had been set up at the SDM College of Ayurveda. The Kasturba Hospital in Manipal had been told to set up a 100-bed isolation ward.

People in hundreds from Mysuru and Bengaluru cities have returned to their villages ever since the COVID-19 fallout began to unfold early this month. However, it reached a peak a day before the 21-day lockdown was announced. Also, the four-hour window between Prime Minister Narendra Modi making the announcement — at 8 p.m. on March 24 — and the lockdown being implemented — at midnight — saw many workers leave in private vehicles to their villages. There is hardly a village in Mysuru district where men had not abandoned agriculture and migrated to urban areas in search of greener pastures. “A majority of them were daily wage workers in the construction sector, and many have now returned home,” said Puttamadhu, of the State Agricultural Workers’ Union. “K.M. Doddi village in Mandya district, where I live, has scores of families with at least one member who has returned in view of the lockdown.” This is also true for villages in the H.D. Kote-Nanjangud-Chamarajanagar belt, from where a large number of men tend to migrate to Mysuru, Kodagu and the adjoining bordering States of Tamil Nadu and Kerala in search of work in plantations. But the reverse migration started to kick in once the curbs began to be announced. “Many workers took a cue from the ‘Janata Curfew’ and managed to return within the short window they had before the nationwide lockdown came into effect. But workers in hundreds are still stranded, unable to return to their villages owing to the suspension of transportation,” said Atahalli Devaraj, of the Karnataka State Sugarcane Cultivators’ Association. Kurubur Shanthakumar, president of the association, said that even people who had left their villages about 20 years ago have returned in large numbers and rejoined their families, and this has resulted in a problem of another sort. “There is a glut of labour force in rural areas. The agricultural season is over and there is no farm work. Also, none of those who returned are adept at agriculture-related work, and hence they will be without employment till normality returns,” he said. The only silver lining, he said, is that they are with their families and will not go hungry."

However, the complaint has not been registered yet. She alleged that the police beat her husband severely on the road and dragged him into the police station, where they continued to beat him. According to her, when she went to meet him in the station, she was not allowed inside but could hear her husband being assaulted.The police got a medical examination done and produced Mr. Ahmed before a magistrate, who ordered his release.

The court said the government should come out with a comprehensive plan to supply food and foodgrains to the poor.Also observing that the government has to re-examine supplying food in Indira Canteens as it results in mass gathering of people, the court asked the State to consider the need to supply foodgrains to the poor based on photo ID cards, without insisting on ration cards, under the present circumstances.A Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V.

Yediyurappa, who chaired a high-level meeting of Ministers and senior officials, announced that excess milk procured by the KMF would be distributed to the poor and the slum residents in cities and towns through urban local bodies from Thursday.The KMF procures nearly 69 lakh litres of milk daily, and about 42 lakh litres is being sold in markets. Of the remaining 27 lakh litres, the KMF uses nearly 20 lakh to produce byproducts. The excess 7 lakh litres will now be distributed to the poor during the lockdown. The government has paid ₹32 crore to the federation for purchasing this milk, at a rate of ₹36 a litre.The closure of hotels, reverse migration from cities to villages, and the stoppage in transportation of milk to other States has resulted in the KMF procuring excess milk, a top federation official told The Hindu.The CM also said there was no need to panic, as sufficient stockof iems was available and markets would remain open. He appealed to the public to purchase essential items needed only for 2-3 days at a time, while also practising social distancing.He instructed Horticulture Department officials to open Horticultural Producers’ Cooperative Marketing and Processing Society (HOPCOMS) outlets throughout the day in cities. To enable consumers to buy eggs, the government has directed HOPCOMS to sell them.Market for perishablesFor providing markets for perishable produce, Mr. Yediyurappa instructed the Deputy Commissioners of all districts to procure vegetables and fruits from farmers and make arrangements to sell them in urban areas. The police have been instructed to ensure the uninterrupted movement of essential goods.All rice, dal mills and agricultural processing units will remain open.

Officials in the Agriculture Department have been instructed to pay special attention while dealing with farm inputs such as fertilizers, pesticides and seeds.With many vegetables and fruits such as tomato, watermelon, muskmelon, and grapes being transported to markets in other States, the Chief Minister directed officials at check-posts to allow the entry of goods vehicles transporting farm produce. Stern action will be taken against officials denying entry to such vehicles. Steps have been taken to transport tomatoes to processing units, he added.Liquor shops closed till April 14Despite pressure from the liquor lobby to allow liquor shops to remain open during the 21-day lockdown, Mr. Yediyurappa on Wednesday said no liquor shops would be open till April 14.Since the lockdown came into effect, the government has ordered the closure of all bars and restaurants, clubs and other outlets selling liquor. Though the sector brings in nearly ₹20,000 crore annually to the State exchequer, the Chief Minister has decided against the sale of liquor during the lockdown.Defending the decision, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said, “We are providing only food, not liquor.”In the neighbouring State of Kerala, seven people ended their lives, allegedly over the non-availability of liquor, and this forced the Excise Department in the State to issue passes to supply alcohol.CompensationChief Minister also announced a compensation of ₹5 lakh to the family of a farmer who ended his life following crop loss during the lockdown.

There have been reports from across the State of farmers, in despair, destroying their own crop.Yogesh, a farmer who grew muskmelon in Sira, Tumakuru, said that with no labour for harvesting and no transportation facilities to take it to the market, his produce was left to rot in the field. “I gave all my fruits for free to whoever came to my farm. I spent another ₹10,000 to clear the land and throw away all the rotten fruits into a tank nearby,” he said. Thimmanna B.G., a farmer who grew tomatoes at Hiriyur in Chitradurga, dumped 15 tonnes of his produce on a dry tank bed as he could not transport it to the market. “I invested ₹25 lakh, taking a loan of ₹17 lakh, only to throw my produce into a tank,” he said. He demanded that the government provide compensation to farmers. In Belagavi, Azad Desai, a cabbage farmer from M. Mallapur village, let cattle graze on his one-acre cabbage crop that was ready for harvest, while, another farmer in the district ploughed through his cabbage field. At Shanivarasante in Kodagu, a farmer threw a truckload of chillies on to the street, while, over the last one week, several tomato growers dumped their harvest on the streets at the markets after it fetched only a pittance and there were no buyers in Kolar, Mandya and Tumakuru districts.In Shikaripur, represented in the Assembly by Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa, and Sorab taluks of Shivamogga district, muskmelon and watermelon are rotting away in the fields. Prabhu Kumar C.B., a farmer from Shikaripur who has grown muskmelon of the Kohinoor variety on his two-acre plot, said, “Cracks have developed on the fruits owing to excess temperature. They are rotting in the field.”Rangappa, a watermelon farmer from Sorab, said the owners of fruit mandis in Mumbai and Bengaluru had approached him in the second week of March to purchase his produce, but there are no takers now. Labour shortageYet another problem is the severe labour crunch in villages. “Labourers and drivers are scared and are not coming to work. Moreover, watermelons and muskmelons are harvested by specialised labourers who come from outside; they have also stopped work,” said Srinivas, a farmer from Srinivaspura in Kolar. There is palpable anger against the government and elected representatives over what is being called an “ill-planned lockdown” and the government not coming to the rescue of farmers. In a video clip doing the rounds, a worried farmer from Belagavi, Bhima Nayak, has made an appeal to the government. “We don’t want the government’s free LPG and rice. What I and other farmers like me need is a market for the produce that we have grown on our fields.”Farmers’ leaders said the crisis has put the spotlight on the lack of adequate cold storage infrastructure in the State. “Farmers are dumping their produce because of the absence of cold storage facilities at most APMC yards. There is no security for farm produce in the country,” said the Mysuru-based farm activist Vasanthkumar Mysoremath.Kodihalli Chandrashekhar, president of Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha, came down heavily on both the Union and State governments for “shedding crocodile tears” for farmers. “It is commendable that the governments are ensuring workers are paid despite being given off. But farmers are suffering huge losses for no fault of theirs. The government must ensure minimum support price for all crops, failing which it must provide compensation to farmers,” he said.(With inputs from Belagavi, Tumakuru, Chitradurga, Mysuru, Kolar and Bengaluru)"

The incident took place on Wednesday and a section of the local people said the trees were felled as they used to attract bats and it stoked fear in view of their possible role in the spread of the virus. Peeved by the development and also fearing that this could be used as a pretext to fell more trees, environmentalists have brought the issue to the notice of the Forest Department. S. Shyalajesha, environmental activist, said the Singapore cherry trees on Ramanuja Road had a good canopy and fruit-eating bats used to frequent and sometime roost there to forage on the cherries. But the trees were felled on Wednesday owing to the fear of bats.M. Pradeep, a city-based zoologist who has conducted studies on bats in Mysuru, said it is true that bats are carriers of lots of viruses but they do not transmit them to human beings easily. Scientists are still studying as to how and why the novel coronavirus transmission took place, but trees should not be felled merely because they attract bats. He said there are 13 species of commonly found bats in Mysuru, most of which are fruit-eating varieties. “Going by the same logic, one has to axe all the fruit-bearing trees as well across the city, which is ridiculous,” said Mr. Pradeep, cautioning against using bats as a pretext to seek permission for tree-felling.Deputy Conservator of Forests Prashanth Kumar said he would advise the staff down the hierarchy not to issue permission for tree-felling on such grounds. Referring to the Ramanuja Road case, Mr. Prashanth Kumar said the permission for felling was sought in February though the trees were felled on Wednesday.He said bats play an important role in pollination and seed dispersal and they need to be conserved. Their presence should not be used a pretext to axe trees, he said, and added that there are no large bat colonies in Mysuru and hence people should not take the law into their own hands."

In Belagavi, officials are keeping a close watch on places with a history of illicit liquor production. Deputy Commissioner of Excise Basavaraj Nandigawad said that armed escorts have been provided to all vehicles transporting spirit and methyl alcohol between districts and across State borders. In Vijayapura district, where six persons have been arrested in connection with eight cases of illicit liquor trade during the lockdown, the focus is more on awareness. “Besides conducting raids, we are holding awareness programmes, appealing to people not to entertain those engaged in illicit liquor trade as any contact with a person with COVID-19 can put their lives at risk,” said Deputy Commissioner of Excise Ravishankar.In Bidar district, through multiple raids, 240 litres of illicit liquor have been seized in connection with three cases.

This led to a sudden rush, with many people trying to return to their home towns. With buses and other vehicles off the road, people could be seen desperately trying to find means of transportation. This rush threw the idea of social distancing – mandatory to avoid spread of COVID-19 – to the winds.Surprise moveThe announcement by the Chief Minister, soon after inaugurating the war room for COVID-19, came as a a surprise. Earlier in the day. he had told police to strictly enforce a “curfew-like” situation. Stating that the government will enforce “complete nakabandhi” from Wednesday, he justified the window as “several people who took the highway to their home towns were stuck in traffic jams that led to police being directed to let these vehicles pass”. The measure, the Chief Minister explained in a statement, was taken to enable people to be home to celebrate Ugadi.Sources in the Chief Minister's office said that the decision was taken as several thousand people were stuck at various toll booths across the State, and that it would have caused other problems. “This was a one-time decision taken to enable people to reach their destinations. They cannot, however, return or take to the road from Wednesday morning when the total shutdown will be in place,” said a source.CM’s assuranceIn a statement after the Prime Minister’s address to the nation, Mr. Yediyurappa said, “I fully assure the people that our government will take care of people during this hour of crisis.

This is possible if people follow strict home quarantine,” he said.Tarun Bhatnagar, scientist at Indian Council of Medical Research, said that there is no data yet to make the projections. “But as India started preventive measures at an early stage and has stepped up surveillance, we hope there will be a positive impact on containing the infection,” he said.Dr. Bhatnagar is one of the authors of the paper titled ‘Prudent public health intervention strategies to control coronavirus disease 2019 transmission in India: A mathemathical model-based approach”, which was published in the Indian Journal of Medical Research early this month. However, Devi Prasad Shetty, chairman of Narayana Health, who cautioned that over 80,000 persons are likely to be infected in Karnataka, told The Hindu that the prediction was based on how the virus behaved in Italy. “In a State like Karnataka with a population of over 6.5 crore, we need to plan for the worst. My projection may lead to panic, but it is important for us to make estimates and preparations for the worst-possible scenario,” he said. “I may be wrong and I wish I am. But what if I am right?

But mutton prices not only spiked, but also went out of stock in most of the areas. In Bengaluru city, the prices hovered between ₹850 and ₹1,000 per kg as against the normal range of ₹500 and ₹600. A meatseller in Bengaluru blamed it on the lack of transport facilities and the lockdown.Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Services Department officials pointed out that ever since the instances of bird flu were reported, meat prices had shot up as people had stopped eating chicken. However, COVID-19 turned the matter worse as there is no movement of meat or live sheep from different places, they noteD.But the high prices did not deter the people from buying meat as they thronged meat shops in huge numbers and also bought in huge quantities. “We are buying more as we are not sure whether these shops will continue to sell from tomorrow,” said a resident in Bengaluru.As the meat shops drew crowds, people were seen buying meat in a hurry fearing that the police might come anytime to stop the sales as a precautionary measure against COVID-19 since social distancing was hardly maintained.The festival disappointed people in most parts of Mysuru as meat shops remained closed in this city.

While many wanted to leave for their native places as a lockdown had been announced for several districts, including Bengaluru, others were headed to their native places to celebrate Ugadi. Even at Sadahalli Gate, there was a large number of vehicles moving out. A toll executive at Sadahalli toll gate said: “After the outbreak of COVID-19, the number of vehicles passing through the toll gate had reduced. However, on Monday, the number increased considerably. People may be going to celebrate Ugadi or to be with their family during the lockdown,” he said. As the Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) had stopped operating inter-state and intra-state bus services and the South Western Railways had stopped train services to curb the spread of the virus, hundreds of people used private vehicles to leave.At Bagepalli, the police did not allow private and other vehicles from Karnataka to enter Andhra Pradesh. Videos of the A.P. police restricting entry of vehicles were doing the rounds on social media.In Tumakuru though, people said many had returned from cities such as Bengaluru out of fear. Software engineer Navyashree T.R. said: “We came in our car to Tavarekere (Sira taluk) from Bengaluru last Friday to celebrate Ugadi with the family. Our company has asked us to work from home. We have decided to stay in our village till March 31.” Even in Mysuru, the lockdown saw several employees return to their native places."

Since the services didn’t resume, some bus operators functioned from Dhanvatari Road located near KSRTC and BMTC bus stand. Passengers heading to Ballari and Chitradurga had to pay more than ₹1,000 per person. The bus operators also risked the lives of passengers without taking precautionary measures to contain COVID-19.

573,Karnataka,"March 24, 2020 00:59 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,COVID-19 waters down Ugadi celebrations,"Ahead of Ugadi, the city usually wears a festive look with raw mangoes, neem leaves, strings of mango leaves, jaggery and other typical essentials filling the markets and people thronging to them. But the outbreak of COVID - 19 has cast a shadow on the festivities this time. With an atmosphere of fear around the pandemic, the subsequent lockdown, and the prohibitory orders imposed till the end of this month, Ugadi, which will be celebrated on Wednesday, is expected to be watered down this year. Fruits and flowers merchants and growers are the worst hit. G.M. Diwakar, president, K.R. Market Flower Merchants’ Association, said that markets across the city were reeling under huge losses owing to COVID-19. “Kanakambara and mallige which usually costs around ₹400 to ₹450 per kg during Ugadi is now being sold for ₹120 to ₹150. If not for the festival season, they would cost around ₹200,” he said. Mr. Diwakar added that walk-in customers have rarely been found for a week now. “There has a been a dip in regular customers who buy for business as well. Even that business has been hit by at least 50%,” he said. As the government has ordered temples to ensure minimum crowds, the festival celebrations will be restricted to traditions and rituals within the temples.Owing to this, the flower business catering to temples has also been hit, he said.To welcome the new year, people in the city order sweets, especially holige, from caterers and restaurants specialising in the delicacy. However, this year, all the orders have been cancelled. Shivaram D., a city-based caterer, said that they started cancelling orders from the last week itself owing to various reasons.“There is a shortage of staff and commodities and restrictions on travelling. Also, apart from us cancelling orders, even orders have drastically dipped,” he said, adding that people just want to stay at home safely and cook whatever they can. Apart from the lull in vegetable and fruit markets, handloom and silk sales that mark the festival are also conspicuous by their absence owing to the prevailing restrictions. Dip in businessPrakash Prigal, president of The Bangalore Wholesale Cloth Merchants’ Association, said that there was around a 70% dip in business owing to COVID-19. “During the festival season, wholesale clothes from the city have a great demand in south India. Our silk market also has a demand across the city. But the demand has come down. We have postponed all current orders and there has also been a drastic dip in both orders and sales from the second week of March,” he said. Sajjan Raj Mehta, former president, Karnataka Hosiery And Garments’ Association, said that as Ugadi was the beginning of the new year and it fell at the beginning of the summer vacations, the festival atmosphere would usually start at least a week ahead of the festival. “However, this year, due to self imposed restrictions and directions by the government, the business has hit a kind of an all-time low,” he said."

He also said that they were expecting at least 30% increase in footfall over the next few days.Mr. Venkatesh pointed out that after the COVID-19 related restrictions, the civic body had witnessed reduction in the number of footfall in certain areas and increase in certain areas. “For example, the Indira Canteen at Majestic had seen a 15 to 20% dip as it is dependent on the floating population. In some residential areas there was an increase by 15 to 20% in the footfall,” he said.Speaking to The Hindu, an administrative officer of Rewards, one of the two contractors serving Indira Canteen, said that they had all the infrastructure and resources to feed the urban poor. “It will take a day or two to get to know the pattern of consumption.

The report also states that thought there was fear about contracting the virus while at work or during travel to work, most of them were forced to work owing to the fear of losing income and jobs."

577,Karnataka,"March 24, 2020 00:49 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,Equipping Victoria Hospital for COVID-19 fight a challenge,"The State government’s decision to convert Victoria Hospital complex into a dedicated COVID-19 facility is turning out to be a logistical challenge for the Bangalore Medical College and Research Institute (BMCRI). All the hospitals located on Victoria Hospital premises are affiliated to BMCRI.Victoria Hospital, which is a referral tertiary public healthcare facility, houses the Emergency and Trauma Care Centre, PMSSY Superspeciality Hospital, Institute of Nephro Urology, Minto Ophthalmic Hospital, and Vani Vilas Hospital. The 50-bed Mahabodhi Burns Ward, which is the only such facility in the State, is also located on this campus.While the government intends to utilise all the beds (nearly 1,200) in these facilities for COVID patients, sources in the hospital said it may not be possible to disturb the functioning of Vani Vilas and Burns Ward as there is no alternative facility for poor patients. While nearly 250 deliveries, including high risk pregnancies, are attended to at Vani Vilas, the Burns Ward also has the State’s only skin bank.That apart, the Institute of Nephro-Urology caters to renal immuno-compromised patients, who are most vulnerable and catch infections. With nearly 150 patients availing free dialysis here, it will be difficult to relocate them to other hospitals immediately. “The functioning of this institute may also not be disturbed for the time being. However, if the need arises, we will have to shift them to other facilities,” said a senior official in the Medical Education Department.Meanwhile, some BMCRI doctors are apprehensive that the decision may affect the in-patients badly. “We have 117 in-patients and 31 critical cases in the ICU. Where do we shift them if our hospital is converted into a COVID-19 facility?” asked a senior doctor from Emergency and Trauma Care Centre.All put together, the hospital has nearly 100 ventilators and around 80 anaesthetists and intensivists. “Will this be adequate to handle an influx of patients, if the hospital becomes a dedicated facility?” asked another doctor.Sources also said the number of beds will be lesser than what the Chief Minister announced. “The beds will have to spaced adequately in COVID-19 wards. There will have to be a gap of six metres between each bed and this will reduce the actual bed capacity. It may take at least four-five days for all the logistical issues to be sorted out before COVID-19 admission begins here,” sources said.However, P.G. Girish, Director of Medical Education, who is also the Special Officer in charge of PMSSY Hospital, said the load on these hospitals is being gradually reduced. “We have stopped all planned surgeries and are only seeing emergency out patients, emergency admission and emergency Operation Theatre cases. The load will be reduced gradually and COVID-19 wards will be readied,” he said.On the inadequate number of ventilators and specialists to handle the rush, if the need arises, he said specialists including anaesthetists and intensivists will be re-deployed from other hospitals to Victoria. C.N. Manjunath, Director of Sri Jayadeva Institute of Chest Diseases, who is a member of the State COVID-19 taskforce, said the government was aware of the issues. “All cardiac patients will be shifted to Jayadeva Hospital and neuro and stroke patients will be shifted to NIMHANS. Logistical issues will be sorted out soon. The government will procure 1,000 ventilators. A dedicated facility under one roof will help,” he added."

It was just a few minutes after the local police came around asking all the shops to down their shutters. Across the city, similar scenes played out as the police were seen asking many shops that had opened on Monday to close. As per government direction, only provision/ grocery shops, medical shops and pharmacies, milk booths can function. Early in the day, many shops and commercial establishments had opened defying the government directions.

The police came around 11 a.m. and forced us to down the shutters,” he said. Employees of several commercial establishments in the busy Gandhinagar, B.V.K. Iyengar Road and surrounding areas were also found standing near the closed shops, wondering what to do next. “After the Janata Curfew, we assumed that it will be a normal working day and reported for work. With the police and Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) officials closing down all shops, we may just have to go back home,” said one of them. However, in many areas, bakeries that sell tea and cigarettes were found open. On Ring Road, near Jalahalli, a bakery with two shutters, had closed one shutter facing the main road, while the other one towards an inner lane was open. People were seen gathering around, drinking tea and smoking. Meanwhile, Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) buses were plying. Many buses were packed, what with BMTC operating only 50% of its fleet. At the BMTC bus station in Majestic, the passengers had a verbal duel with the corporation officials for not operating more buses."

During the Congress regime (2013–18), only 4,327 families had been given 5,799 acres costing ₹270 crore, the Chief Minister maintained.Noting that 90% of the revenue goes to salaries, pensions, and subsidies for school midday meals and other schemes, the Chief Minister said a Cabinet sub-committee had been formed to study how to reduce the committed expenditure.The size of the Budget had been kept at ₹2,37,893 crore, which is 1.6% larger than that for 2019–20. With a revenue surplus estimated at ₹143.32 crore, the fiscal deficit is expected to be ₹46,072 crore, which is 2.55% of the GSDP.Breaking the convention of seeking a vote on account for the first four months of the financial year, the government tabled the Finance Bill and other related Bills, and passed the entire Budget for 2020–21.The entire Opposition was absent during the Chief Minister’s reply to the debate on the Budget. The Congress boycotted the last day’s session opposing the government decision on passage of the entire Budget for 2020-21 and other Bills without adequate debate in the House. JD(S) members staged a walkout from the House when they did not get a reply on the debate on irregularities in Apex Bank."

At a mall on Mosque Road, whose grocery and vegetable division was open, Mr. Jagadeesha saw the arrangements made for maintaining distance between the customers and went inside and checked the price of various vegetables. He told the manager of the mall to follow the directions of the government. But at another mall near Jodu Katte, whose grocery and vegetable wing was open, Mr. Jagadeesha was angry at the air-conditioning functioning there, which was a violation of the administration’s direction. He also took the manager of the mall to task for charging more price for the vegetables. He directed Udupi tahsildar Pradeep Kurdekar to take necessary action.

Jagadeesha, visited it to check the implementation of restrictions announced by the State government on account of COVID-19. The administration on March 23 instructed the fishermen to stop fishing activities on Tuesday. When Mr. Jagadeesha visited the harbour, fish was being unloaded from the boats and being loaded into some mini trucks. Mr. Jagadeesha questioned the president of Malpe Fishermen’s Association, Krishna Suvarna, as to why the activities had not stopped at the harbour. Mr. Suvarna and other fishermen told Mr. Jagadeesha that about 100 mechanised boats had just returned from the sea and had seven tonnes of fish each. If this fish was thrown back into the sea, it would lead to pollution as they would get washed on the beaches. They urged him to allow the unloading of fish till Wednesday evening. Mr. Jagadeesha said that it was binding on the association and fishermen to follow the instructions of the administration. When Mr. Jagadeesha questioned about the large number of people who came to buy fish at the harbour on Tuesday morning, the fishermen said that some persons who had come to purchase fish and spread the message that fish was available at low rates resulting in the large numbers. “We stopped people from entering the harbour at 9 a.m.,” Mr. Suvarna said. Then Mr. Suvarna said a large number of fishermen from other places were working at Malpe harbour and the administration should make arrangements to send them home. Mr. Jagadeesha said that the mechanised boat owners should transport them to their places in private vehicles."
592,Karnataka,"March 26, 2020 20:45 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,COVID-19 | Karnataka government promises to remove bottlenecks in supply chain,"Restrictions on movement of goods vehicles have severely disrupted supply chains of farmers-wholesalers and wholesale-retail creating an artificial scarcity in the State leading to panic buying. Given the demand, many retailers have increased the price of essential commodities and vegetables. To make matters worse, due to low stock Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) yards across the State were closed on Wednesday and Thursday. The government on Thursday held a special meeting of all wholesalers, after which APMCs announced that they will reopen on Friday and function from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. every day. “We have stock of pulses only for three days and rice for eight days. Trucks laden with rice and wheat, pulses and oil are stranded on national highways. So we shut down. Now the government has assured us that there will be no restrictions on the movement of heavy vehicles both inter- and intra-State. Subject to removal of all bottlenecks as promised, we have decided to re-open,” said Ramesh Chandra Lahoti, chairman, APMC Committee, FKCCI. This is expected to ease the situation for retailers to a large extent.While police are being blamed for the disruption of supply chains, a senior police official said such a lockdown was unprecedented, and there were several teething problems which he assured would be ironed out over the next few days.“There is a strict instruction to seal district borders and stop inter-district movement. But we are facing traffic pile-up at these borders. Goods vehicles are getting stuck. In some cases, it will be tough to manage crowds while selectively allowing vehicles to cross borders,” a senior police official said, adding they were trying their best to enable movement of goods vehicles. While movement of essential goods across district borders have been streamlined to a large extent, the same cannot be said for State borders. However, the State government has assured wholesalers that the problem will be sorted out. Tomatoes, probably, serve as the best illustration of the resultant problem. Due to short supply in the city, the cost of a kilo of the vegetable has gone up to ₹80. However, it was trading at ₹10/kg in Kolar and ₹2/kg in Tiptur. “So the problem is not of shortage of produce, but disruption of supply chains,” said B.N. Prasad, Managing Director, HOPCOMS. “If farmers are not able to bring perishable goods to the markets, the produce will perish causing more stress to farmers,” he added. Safety measuresHealth concerns are being raised at these wholesale markets. “There are no preventive measures at APMC yards. We fear the spread of the infection. There are goods from Maharashtra, which is a hotspot for COVID-19. Officials have now assured that they will help us observe social distancing, provide us with thermal scanners and other preventive measures,” said Mr. Lahoti. HOPCOMS suggests that instead of Kalasipalyam, the crowded and narrow wholesale market in the city, vegetables need to be distributed in stadiums and playgrounds across the city."

The first day of the initiative was marked by miscommunication and chaos at Shankarapura after wholesale traders from the Kalasipalyam market started shifting their produce to the National College Grounds under the impression that they had been granted permission to do so by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). This misconception arose after civic officials reached out to the merchants to discuss the merits of a relocation. According to sources in the BBMP, the decision was not final and no arrangements were made for the move. However, several merchants thought the matter was settled and started moving their produce on Friday night itself. BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said talks on shifting the market were still in progress at the time and nothing had been agreed upon. “In the meantime, without any communication and permission, they all of a sudden shifted to National College Grounds,” he said. As word spread, hundreds of residents and retail buyers thronged the ground, throwing any semblance of maintaining social distancing to the wind. The rules of the lockdown in the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic were forgotten and hundreds of vehicles were parked outside the ground while the police watched helplessly. All the wholesalers were finally evicted around 11 a.m. by the BBMP, after residents and elected representatives intervened. D.N. Ramesh, councillor, Sunkenahalli ward, said the chaos was created because of mismanagement and miscommunication from wholesalers and civic officials. S. Manjunath, of Shankarapuram Residents’ Welfare Association, urged the authorities not to shift entire markets to grounds located in residential areas as it would defeat the purpose of social distancing and the lockdown. “If only retailers and pushcart vendors are allowed in, then the Fort High School Ground will be a better option,” he said, adding that the National College Grounds should not be converted into a wholesale market. New locationThe BBMP finally decided to shift the Kalasipalyam wholesale market to Singena Agrahara in Anekal taluk. “We have assured the merchants that arrangements for a temporary market will be made at Singena Agrahara, with all the precautionary measures, from Monday. We have asked licensed wholesale merchants to shift there as soon as possible,” a BBMP official said. The BBMP Commissioner said there were 423 licensed wholesale merchants operating out of the two-acre Kalasipalyam market, with hundreds of trucks and lorries, and thousands of retailers, pushcart vendors and even residents visiting every day. “Hence, social distancing is impossible there. At Singena Agrahara, there is a 43-acre plot available, with a fruit market already operating from there,” he said."

However, this has not gone down well with senior officials in the police and other departments. “It dilutes the purpose of the lockdown. How can we enforce it if hundreds of vehicles have road passes?” asked a senior police officer. To prevent people from gathering at their respective Deputy Commissioner of Police offices to collect passes, the police have started issuing them online. “This means that more people will get them,” the officer said. Another police officer raised a complaint saying that her friend was able to get a pass for her domestic help. “This is sheer misuse and needs immediate action,” the officer said. On Saturday, there was a noticeable increase in traffic on the roads.According to sources, the idea of a total lockdown came into question after a face-off between Deputy Chief Minister C.N. Ashwath Narayan and Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao at a meeting held in Vidhana Soudha recently. “Mr. Ashwath Narayan accused Mr. Rao of favouritism for allowing some food chains to operate and restricting others.

Anand Gowda, a food delivery personnel who works with Zomato said that he has been working for nearly 15 hours a day. He said that the number of orders has declined only marginally. “I used to deliver 25 orders earlier. Now on an average I am getting 21 orders a day,” he said. The B.Com graduate who used to work in a car showroom decided to switch to this job as it had promised to get him a salary of ₹13,000. On Sunday, he started work at 1 p.m. but could not eat anything till 7 p.m. “My family is concerned about my safety and does not want me to do this job. But if I need to earn a meal for my family, then I need to work,” he said. While customers opt for contactless delivery and ask them to deliver the food at their doorstep so that they don’t come in contact with him, he says he comes in contact with several people including many at restaurants. While some restaurants have sanitisers for delivery boys, this is not available at many places. Another delivery person who works with Dunzo said the company has provided them with a mask and sanitizer and has advised them to use it regularly. “I make sure I only do limited deliveries enough to earn two meals for my family. After that I log off, and go home,” he said. However, many of his colleagues have gone back to their villages as they did not want to take the risk. What irks many delivery personnel is that people continue to buy even non-essential items. “We are happy to help people in times of a crisis like this. But we still get orders from people ordering one juice or one dessert. We hope that people will stick to basics at least during this time,” said another delivery agent working with Swiggy. He admits that customers however have been generous while tipping. “Several customers give us masks, a meal or essential items for our households.”"

However, its efficacy has been criticised with many saying that not only is it difficult to get through, but several requests successfully placed are also going unattended. “Even after over a week since its launch, it is not fully functional. Several requests made on the helpline go unattended for days, with helpline staff not knowing how long it will take to fulfil them,” said Vinay Sreenivasa, of Naavu Bharateeyaru, which works with poor and migrant labourers.Those manning the helpline concede that there is a problem of demand and supply. “An overwhelmed helpline is finding it tough to match demand with supply,” said P. Manivannan, secretary, Labour Department, overseeing the helpline efforts. As the situation stands today, there is a gap of at least 15% between the demand for food that the helpline registers and what is being delivered every day, he added. Presently, the helpline is sourcing food from six vendors including Wipro, Art of Living and Admaya Chetana, totalling to at least over 1.5 lakh meals daily, which is apart from several other initiatives also serving the same demography.Demand rises On Monday, the helpline had a supply of 93,000 meals for lunch and 78,500 meals for dinner. “The problem of demand is several times more in its magnitude than we initially estimated,” said Mr. Manivannan. He said the Labour Department is working with unions to map vulnerable labourers. “The unions say there is a need to provide at least two lakh meals, a day. We are working on ramping up our supplies. More people are needed to open up community kitchens and help in the time of need,” he said.The discontinuing of free food at Indira Canteens has only increased demand, said sources at the Hunger Helpline. Around 96,000 meals were being served daily at Indira Canteens before it was stopped. Ironing out glitchesThe Hunger Helpline is sorting out other glitches. For instance, on an average, it gets over 6,000 calls seeking help each day, and many are still not getting through. “We started with 20 phone lines and ramped it up to 70 lines. But it is still not enough. In a day or two, we will increase it to 120 lines,” Mr. Manivannan said. “One of the major challenges we face is the duplication of needs. For a single group of labourers, multiple people call and place requests for entire groups duplicating demand. By the time we discover the duplication, it may be too late and some others in need may not get food,” he said.To correct this, volunteers from Swiggy have now developed a geotagging feature in the ‘Dasoha’ software the department has been using to match demand and supply. “Since requests for food and later delivery are now geo-tagged, we will be able to solve the issue of duplications to a large extent. It will also help us track demand well,” Mr. Manivannan said."

In Bengaluru, the theatre space, Rangashankara, has reinvented itself and is trying to reach out to the theatre community and its audience, online. As part of the initiative, more than 20 actors, directors, playwrights and thespians from language theatres across the country have performed monologues from their favourite theatre texts for the camera and shared it online. These include performances by Shabana Azmi, Sihi Kahi Chandru, Mandya Ramesh, Mukhyamantri Chandru and B. Jayashree, while actor Umashree has performed a play after several years. This campaign is also part of the 15th anniversary celebrations of Rangashankara. Those who couldn't record a video have still participated with an audio recording. “With the lockdown, our lifeline to the audience was cut off. At Rangashankara, we never celebrated World Theatre Day, as we argued we do it every day. But this year was different. As a community space, we realised we had a role to play to keep theatre alive. What we could do now was only work with monologues as all of us are locked up at home. The response we got from the community has been very encouraging,” said Arundhati Nag, founder of Rangashanakara, who has performed a monologue from Girish Karnad’s play Anju Mallige, her first Kannada production. Live-streaming of plays has become the norm abroad, but remains untapped here. Has COVID-19 forced the theatre community in the country to explore the video as a medium? “We at Rangashankara have tried recording plays for archival purposes, but have failed to do great work like at NCPA, Mumbai. I feel a play in video is reductionist as it doesn't give that wholesome experience,” Ms. Nag said. Umashree, who started with theatre and went on to become a noted film actor, said the experience of recording the monologue was strange. “I enacted a theatre text to the camera,” she said, but added that after years before the camera she was accustomed to it. Filmmaker B. Suresha had a different take. “Even at Rangashankara, we have tried to live-stream plays when we got Shakespeare’s Globe Theatre. But only a handful of people watched it online. Theatre requires that human element,” he said."

615,Karnataka,"April 11, 2020 11:08 IST",Health,New Delhi:,COVID-19: IIT-B researchers’ ‘smart stethoscope’ can hear heart beats from a distance,"A team at the Indian Institute of Technology of Bombay (IIT-B) has developed a “digital stethoscope” that can listen to heart beats from a distance and record them, minimising the risk of healthcare professionals contracting the novel coronavirus from patients.The data or the auscultated sound from a patient’s chest is wirelessly sent to the doctor using Bluetooth, doing away with the need to go near to take readings, according to members of the team.The IIT-B team has received a patent for the device that records the auscultated sound and stores it as part of a patient’s health record. This can be shared with other doctors for analysis as well as follow ups. Operating a start-up called “AyuDevice” from the IIT’s technology business incubator, the team has sent 1,000 stethoscopes to different hospitals and healthcare centres across the country. The product has been developed with clinical inputs from doctors at Reliance Hospital and PD Hinduja Hospital.“Patients diagnosed with coronavirus often experience shortness of breath, leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome. Doctors use (traditional) stethoscope to listen to chest sounds such as wheezing and crackles that appear with the progress of the disease,” one of the developers Adarhsa K said. This however, poses a risk to doctors, as evident from the rising infections reported among healthcare professionals handling COVID-19 patients, he said.Giving details about the digital stethoscope, Adarsha said it “consists of a tube connected to two earpieces. The tube transmits sounds from the body while eliminating background noise that might interfere with diagnosis“.“The second advantage is that the stethoscope is able to amplify and filter several sounds and translate them into an electronic signal, which can be further amplified for optimal listening,” he said.“The signal can then be displayed as a phonocardiogram on a smartphone or laptop. In contrast, a regular stethoscope is limited when it comes to amplifying sounds and there is no way of recording those sounds and sharing from one place to another. Even visualisation is not possible, which means one cannot see the graph and identify abnormalities,” he added. The death toll due to the novel coronavirus rose to 239 and the number of cases to 7,447 in the country on Saturday, according to the Union Health Ministry.While the number of active COVID-19 cases is 6,565, as many as 642 people were cured and discharged and one had migrated, it said."

The medicine had to be procured from a far-off place in Palakkad district of Kerala and not just across the State boundary. None could help her since her husband is working abroad and her two children are in Bengaluru. The possibilities of travelling all the way, crossing the border, seemed impossible to her in the present condition.But help came in the form of a few activists of the Students Federation of India (SFI), Democratic Youth Federation of India (DYFI) and the Fire and Emergency Services of Kerala and Karnataka.Her relative Jackson Vas informed her plight to his neighbour and SFI office-bearer Madhuri Bolar, who got in touch with her comrades in Kerala and soon they arranged for the medicines by contacting Sree Narayana Pharmaceuticals at Ottapalam in Palakkad district. Activists there took the help of Kerala Fire and Rescue Services, who dropped off the consignment at Talapady on the Karnataka-Kerala border on Wednesday. Ms. D’Souza received the consignment on Thursday through Karnataka Fire and Emergency Services personnel.Mr. Vas recalled that Ms. D’Souza, a resident of Kumpala on the outskirts of Mangaluru, was diagnosed to be in the final stage of bone cancer a couple of years ago and doctors did not give any assurance to her. When some of her acquaintances informed her about availability of ayurvedic medicines at Ottapalam, she saw no harm in giving it a try. Since it appeared to give her relief, she was keen to continue with it, said Mr. Vas. Now, thanks to the volunteers, she can do so lockdown notwithstanding."

The constables warned a shopkeeper of action if he failed to ensure social distancing in front of his shop. This triggered an argument with the accused. They allegedly scolded the police in foul language. Later, Bharatha joined the argument and claimed that he could get the policemen transferred by contacting senior officials immediately “as was done in the case of PSI Balu”, the man who had arrested the Hindutva activist.Following this, senior police officers, including Additional Superintendent of Polie B.N. Nandini, visited the spot. Jagadish, a police constable, has filed a complaint. Superintendent of Police R. Srinivasa Gowda on Friday said that a case has been booked against the four and that they would be arrested soon.When it was pointed out that disciplinary action against the PSI of Arehalli would demoralise police personnel, the SP said that the situation warranted such an administrative decision. “The PSI has not been transferred, but he is on official duty in the SP’s office. We wanted officers to handle applications seeking travel passes during the lockdown,” he said.The SP has ordered a probe against PSI Balu and Belur CPI S. Siddarameshwara for releasing a photo of the Hindutva activist to the media. Tourism Minister C.T. Ravi had objected to the arrest of the activist and appealed to the Home Minister on Twitter to take action against the police officers."

With food, fertilisers, defence, processing and pharma industries allowed to work during the lockdown, the trade unions urged the State government to ensure transport and canteen facilities, along with compliance with the social distancing norm.The JCTU also urged the State to introduce hazard pay as COVID-19 allowance and insurance for frontline workers, relief for self-employed drivers, and direct cash benefits for construction workers and unorganised workers registered under various schemes."

We have been able to sell nearly 320 tonnes of premium grape produce in the last 13 days,” said K. Narayana Gowda, president of the alumni association.Consumers could buy Sharad/Krishna and Sonalika varieties for ₹60 a kg, as against ₹150 in supermarkets, and Red Globe for ₹90, as against ₹200 at private shops. “We now want to increase these prices to ₹70 and ₹100, respectively,” Dr. Gowda said. This initiative has helped in stabilising the market for premium varieties as the middlemen themselves have started quoting a farm gate price of ₹60 for these varieties, said some farmers.“I have been growing grapes for the last 30 years. But this is the first time that we are getting money on hand, soon after the sale of our produce. The middlemen, who used to buy our produce earlier, would pay us in instalments over a period of time,” said Krishnappa, a grower of Red Globe variety of grape from Harohalli in Devanahalli. Nandagopal, another grape farmer from Harohalli, profusely thanked the consumers in Bengaluru. “Some of the consumers even sat with us and carried out the work of weighing the produce. They gave us moral support, gave their mobile numbers, and assured us of spreading the word about the quality of our grapes among their friends,” he said.The association is now thinking of fine-tuning the direct sales mechanism and making permanent arrangements for carrying out such activities from next year.Associations interested may place orders with Gopal, an alumni association executive committee member, through WhatsApp, SMS or call on 81979 77076 or 92424 11611.

647,Karnataka,"April 19, 2020 00:40 IST",Bengaluru,K.V. Aditya Bharadwaj,"Salary for April: Garment, security services severely hit","Garment workers and people employed in security services have been badly hit by the extension of the lockdown. Most of them lead a hand-to-mouth existence and many say that they have not received their salaries. Nearly 4.5 lakh people - mostly women - work in garment factories where they are employed on a contract and are usually paid only for the days they report to work. Violating a Labour Department directive that made paying the full salary of March mandatory, several factories have treated March 25-31, when the factories were closed due to a national lockdown as earned leave of the employees for the year, while a handful of factories even deducted pay for these days, said K.R. Jayaram of Garments and Textiles Workers Union (GATWU). “Most of the garment factories while paying salaries for March, orally told workers not to expect any pay for April if the factories do not open again. This is going to be disastrous,” he added.Rajamma, a garment worker from Kengeri, says she’s better off than many of her colleagues as she has a BPL card which she uses to get ration. “But I will have to pay rent and other bills including medical expenses. I am the breadwinner in my family. A month without salary will push me into debt that will take over a year to come out of,” she said. GATWU is affiliated with IndustriAll Global Union, a global union of trade unions based out of Copenhagen, which has taken up a global campaign for garment workers. “The principal employer of garment workers are apparel brands. In times of crisis like these, the apparel brands need to share responsibility. Through IndustriAll Global Union, we are lobbying with the apparel brands which get their apparel produced in Bengaluru to reach out to us,” Mr. Jayaram said. “But the brands are not responding positively. Most of them have suspended even orders they had already placed,” he said. GATWU is also lobbying with the State government to ensure all garment workers are paid full wages.Security guardsSecurity guards are deemed an essential service and most of them are indeed working. However, nearly a lakh guards of the estimated four lakh have been told not to report to work. “Deployment at commercial establishments like factories, tech parks and malls has reduced by half. Many firms have expressed that they were already reeling under losses and they cannot pay for those not deployed on their premises. Negotiations are on with them. The security firms are also trying their best to pay by availing loans,” said Flt. Lt. Nagesh, a mentor with Karnataka Security Services Association."

As per a pilot project, vendors will sell fruits and vegetables at each lane every day at a specific time. “Police personal accompanying vendors will ensure that residents maintain a distance from each other and get their daily supplies without much hassle,” said Deputy Commissioner of Police (South) Rohini Katoch Sepat Sepat. People thronging to markets and grocery stores to buy essentials and hoarding supplies remains a challenge. “By assigning a constable to every vendor at a particular time, we hope to resolve such issues and also avoid unwanted competition among vendors,” she added.Encouraging artThe South Division police are urging citizens to explore their creative side during this enforced period at home. They have launched a ‘Stay home, stay safe. When lockdown met art’ campaign, which includes a drawing competition on the theme of ‘nature’ for children below 14 years. Those above 15 years can participate in an essay writing competition on the theme ‘gratitude’. Citizens can upload their work on the police’s social media website. Ms. Sepat tweeted a poster of the art campaign. “The biggest challenge in our fight against the coronavirus is making residents stay indoors,” she said."

650,Karnataka,"April 19, 2020 23:05 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,Rumours over quarantine fuels violence at Padarayanapura,"Late on Sunday night, some youth allegedly tried to clear the barricades put up at Padarayanapura, which has been sealed by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, triggering violence. The youth were spurred by rumours of people being taken away from the area for quarantine.BBMP officials told The Hindu that secondary contacts have been identified in Padarayanapura that has already been sealed by the civic body. Civic officials had shifted one batch of the secondary contacts to the hotels identified for quarantine purpose. “While one batch was shifted, shifting of the second batch got delayed. The residents expressed apprehension and later agreed to be shifted on Monday morning,” the official said. The official added that usually the secondary contacts are put on home-based quarantine. “However, considering that the area is densely populated and taking into account that the secondary contacts may not follow the home-based quarantine rules strictly, it was decided to shift them to hotels,” the official added. Additional police personnel were posted in the area to enforce law and order. The local councillor, Imran Pasha, was unavailable for comment."
651,Karnataka,"April 19, 2020 23:10 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,Security guards enforce social distancing in city apartments,"Security guards in their uniforms stationed at the entrance of apartment complexes and buildings have become crucial gatekeepers for residents. They ensure that tradesmen and delivery agents do not enter the premises. “They play a critical role in enforcing the lockdown and social distancing in large residential colonies and even on the streets to some extent,” said a senior police officer.Most security guards have families in other parts of the State and country. Their lives, too, have been disrupted by the lockdown with the lack of public transport and inadequate facilities such as food. Several of them are also facing the prospect of no pay during the lockdown. Bishnu Prasad, a security guard posted at an apartment in Vidyaranyapura, said he used to earlier travel to a room he had rented, but ever since the lockdown was imposed he has been staying in a room in the apartment itself. “The residents have been kind to provide me food,” he said. He had to shift as he travelled nearly 10 km every day to work by a BMTC bus, which is now off the road. Several other guards face the same issue as buses have gone off the road. Flt. Lt. K.P. Nagesh, mentor, Karnataka Security Services Association, said agencies usually post guards in the same area they live. “A small percentage of them travel long distances. Most of our guards travel on cycles as they live nearby,” he said, adding that those on the rolls, who lived far from the buildings they were assigned to, have either been shifted to places closer to their residence or given time off. In most apartments, security guards are now given the task of enforcing social distancing, as the associations have imposed several restrictions on movement of residents in the common areas and are levying fine on violators. This is turning out to be tricky for the guards. Many said night shifts were becoming more difficult. Selva Kumar, a security guard, wishes he had his daily dose of tea and cigarettes to keep him awake. “Usually, we smoke and drink several cups of tea to keep ourselves awake but we don’t have the luxury now,” he said, and added that stray dogs, most of them starving, have become more aggressive, but they seem to be keeping mischief makers also at bay,” he said."

653,Karnataka,"April 19, 2020 20:55 IST",Karnataka,Belagavi,Tablighi Jamaat has pockets of influence in North Karnataka,"Tablighi Jamaat may not have been a well-known sect until the recent instances of COVID-19 spreading from one of their conventions in New Delhi, but it has a following in small pockets, particularly in North Karnataka. As many as six couples from Indonesia, belonging to Tablighi Jamaat, were quarantined in Belagavi last month, while a group from Kyrgyzstan was camping in Bidar.Syed Shabbir, a sect member from Belagavi, said that travelling in groups is a distinct feature of the sect. A typical Tablighi follower leaves home for 10 to 40 days a year, travelling long distances to spread the message of Islam among Muslims in other cities, States or countries. They are shoestring travellers and mostly use public transport. They stay in mosques in different cities and carry foodgrains and utensils, which they use to cook in the mosque for the group. They go door to door in Muslim colonies, inviting people to attend prayers at the mosque.Scholars emphasise that people of the sect do not reach out to non-Muslims. “It is wrong to believe that they are an evangelical or proselytizing group. Their motto is ‘Muslims should become better Muslims’,” said Syed Ubaidur Rahman, a Delhi-based author and scholar of Islamic history.Maqsood Chanda, a doctor from Bidar, said that while several other sects cater to the rich or the middle classes, Tablighi Jamaat works among the poor and the rural masses. “Such work at the grassroot level helps the poor identify themselves with the sect,” he said. He reasoned that awareness about COVID-19 among the sect members was low because most of them were illiterate or uneducated. “Their leaders usually don’t discuss issues other than religion. That has led to most sect members remaining oblivious to political developments or current affairs. That is one reason there is low awareness among them about medical emergencies,” he said.Mohammad Yusuf Raheem, a writer and commentator on religious issues, concurred. “The term ‘Tabligh’ means to carry a message or outreach. ‘Jamaat’ means society. They are entirely apolitical. They don’t discuss issues of politics, unlike some other Jamaats. Their entire focus is religion.”‘Not deliberate’Moulana Shabbir Ahmed, public relations officer of the Tablighi Jamaat in Bengaluru, said those who attended the Delhi meeting may have displayed some irresponsibility, but it was because of lack of awareness, not a deliberate act.He said that the Nizamuddin Markaz has only a small percentage of followers in Karnataka. Between 90% and 95% of Tablighi Jamaat members in the State follow the Shura sect of the Jamaat, which is distinct from the centre at Nizamuddin.The Tabligh movement was founded in New Delhi around 1925 by preacher Mohammad Ilyas Al Khandalwi. He wanted Muslims to understand the basics of religion and practise rituals that would make them true Muslims. “He was a believer of the Deobandi school of thought. He and other leaders such as Moulana Zakaria wanted to start a reformist movement in response to the Shuddhi movement of the Arya Samaj. They are popular among the common man as they have simplified the tenets of Islam,” Mr. Rahman said."
654,Karnataka,"April 19, 2020 20:36 IST",Karnataka,MYSURU,Rigorous border checks at the start have helped Chamarajanagar remain free of COVID-19,"Rigorous screening at check-posts set up on the borders with Kerala and Tamil Nadu, and relatively low exposure to the outer world, has helped Chamarajanagar district, one of the backward regions of the State, remain free of COVID-19 cases as on Saturday. The institutional quarantine facility in Chamarajanagar is empty. There are no mask-clad officials or doctors. The rooms are empty and row after row of beds meant for COVID-19 patients have been rolled up and the premises spruced and sanitised. The 36 paramedical staff and 92 doctors deployed on duty are a relaxed lot and there is no buzz of an ambulance. “We brought in stringent regulations at the check-posts on borders with the neighbouring States, and even at the check-posts with Mysuru after the Nanjangud factory incident. These check-posts were manned by police, Revenue Department and medical personnel, and every vehicle was sanitised and the passengers screened,” said Deputy Commissioner M.R. Ravi.The screening commenced on January 31, a day after Kerala reported the country’s first COVID-19 case, he said. There were also surprise midnight checks by the Deputy Commissioner and the Superintendent of Police. Gundlupet and Chamarajanagar towns have a high degree of trade and commerce with Kerala and Tamil Nadu, with hundreds of trucks moving in both directions daily. “Even the empty trucks coming in from Kerala and Tamil Nadu to procure vegetables directly from farmers were not spared and were thoroughly sanitised as preventing the infection from entering the district was the priority,” Mr. Ravi explained.In another departure from conventional methods, the district administration did not allow the luxury of home quarantine for any suspects, lest they violate the norms, as has been frequently reported across the State and country. Fortunately for the authorities, out of the 212 people who underwent institutional quarantine in the district, no one tested positive. This included 47 employees of the Nanjangud pharma company who were from Gundlupet and Chamarajanagar. Furthermore, there were nearly a dozen individuals with foreign travel history, and they were shifted from their homes to the institutional quarantine facility for 14 days despite showing no symptoms. Last Thursday, the pharma company employees were brought back to the quarantine centre for another round of swab collection and tests to ensure that they had not developed any symptoms. Their results are awaited. But the vigil is far from over. An army of Accredited Social Health Activists (ASHAs) and anganwadi workers — 750 in all — is scouring the district and conducting a door-to-door survey of nearly 2.5 lakh households, comprising around 11 lakh people. This is to check for SARI and ILI (Severe Acute Respiratory Infection and Influenza-like Illness, respectively). The survey was launched on April 15 to assess if there has been any COVID-19 community transmission. It will be completed on Monday. As on Saturday, there were two SARI cases and 50 ILI cases in the district, and the patients are being constantly monitored."

Yediyurappa on Saturday. It shelved some relaxation measures, including allowing a maximum of one-third of the workforce in the IT/BT sectors and government offices to resume work.With this, all types of industries and services will remain closed till May 3. However, relaxations will continue for agriculture- and horticulture-related activities and agricultural marketing.Briefing reporters on the Cabinet decisions, Law and Parliamentary Minister J.C. Madhuswamy said, “Today’s situation will continue till May 3. We are awaiting fresh guidelines from the Centre, and if any relaxation can be given, the Chief Minister and the task force will discuss it in three or four days. But in principle, the lockdown will continue till May 3 and there will not be any relaxation for now,” he said.Several other States, including Delhi and Telangana, have decided to implement lockdown norms strictly till May 3.On the ordinance, Mr. Madhuswamy said it would unify and consolidate the laws related to the regulation and prevention of epidemic diseases.Like UP and KeralaThe Minister said that the Karnataka Epidemic Diseases Ordinance would be drafted based on the Uttar Pradesh and Kerala models. The Kerala Ordinance, 2020 empowers the government to prohibit any usage or act it considers sufficient to spread or transmit epidemic diseases at any gathering, celebration, worship or other such activities. It also allows the inspection of persons arriving in the State by air, rail, road, sea or any other means, or in quarantine or in isolation, as the case may be. It makes way for the sealing of State borders and the imposition of restrictions on the operations of public and private transport.Mr. Madhuswamy said the ordinance would also include the imposition of a penalty and allow for imprisonment if any person/institution/company is not bound by the regulations of the government.The major objectives are to control the spread of the disease and to provide security to the police and frontline health workers. The ordinance aims to punish those spreading fake news, abetting offences, and not cooperating with the government. It will come into effect after Governor Vajubhai R. Vala gives assent to it.Export matters The Cabinet also resolved to exert pressure on the Union Ministry of Commerce and Industry on the export of spices and coffee from Karnataka. “All markets have closed, so it has been decided that this issue will be raised with the Commerce Department,” Mr. Madhuswamy said."

There are 24 professional theatre troupes in the State. Many leading artistes of the Kannada cinema industry, including Dr. Rajkumar, have commenced their acting journey from professional theatre troupes.The annual fairs and chariot festivals of deities across the State, mostly from from January to April, attract a large number of devotees. These troupes camp in temple towns in north and central Karnataka for two months. The lockdown has entirely disrupted their schedule.This year, after camping in a North Karnataka temple town, Sri Guru Khasgatheshwara Natya Sangha troupe had come to Togarsi village in Shikaripur taluk for the annual chariot festival of Sri Mallikarjuna Temple.

Yediyurappa’s Cabinet were left to defend the government’s decision.On Friday afternoon, the former Chief Minister H.D. Kumaraswamy stated that it was not appropriate to politicise the matter, and urged the government to set right the mistake that it had committed. “ The government is playing around. The government has committed a mistake,” he said, and added that the decision had no rationale. “I had warned the government before,” he told reporters outside the Ramanagaram jail on Bengaluru–Mysuru highway.In a statement, Mr. Kumaraswamy’s wife and Ramanagaram legislator Anitha Kumaraswamy also slammed the government for the fiasco.While government sources indicated that the initial decision to move the accused to Ramanagaram jail was an administrative decision, the issue assumed political colour when Mr. Kumaraswamy, expressing fears of contamination, had opposed the decision, blaming Director-General of Police (Prisons) Alok Mohan for it. Deputy Chief Minister and Ramanagaram district in charge C.N. Ashwath Narayan’s opposition for testing COVID-19 in ESI hospital at Malleswaram, but allowing Ramanagaram to have the Padarayanapura riot accused also came under attack.However, by late Thursday evening when it became clear that two of the inmates had contracted the virus, Mr. Kumaraswamy threatened to launch an agitation to get the inmates from Ramanagaram jail vacated.In Bengaluru, Congress MP D.K. Suresh also blamed the government for the situation. Stating that the government would be held responsible if the virus spreads in Ramanagaram district, Mr. Suresh asked how these people were brought in without conducting tests on them. “ Though we appealed to the Home Minister, our requests were not heeded to,” he added. KPCC president-designate D.K. Shivakumar said the BJP was targeting Ramanagaram since the party failed to win in the district.Sources in the government, however, defended the decision to shift the accused to Ramanagaram jail as one of “administrative” and not political, and in the larger good of prison inmates in the State. Even Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai on Friday defended the move and said it was as per the Supreme Court order.Dr. Ashwath Narayan, defending the decision, said there was no agenda in lodging the Padarayanapura riot accused in Ramanagaram, and that it was a logistical convenience. “It was not possible to keep them at Parappana Agrahara [Bengaluru Central Prison] where there are over 5,000 inmates. Where else could we have held them?”He acknowledged that Mr. Kumaraswamy had raised the fears with both the Chief Minister and the Home Minister.When asked why Ramanagaram, a green zone, was chosen for the purpose, sources said that since it was jail, the threat of contamination was limited. “The decision was taken by the State-level monitoring committee headed by Mr. Mohan after due deliberations,” sources said."
664,Karnataka,"April 24, 2020 20:30 IST",Karnataka,Bengaluru,Armed police protection will be given to healthcare workers: Karnataka government,"The State government on Friday told the High Court of Karnataka that armed police protection would be provided to healthcare workers on COVID-19 duty, depending upon the location and local circumstances. A statement in this regard was filed in response to the court’s queries on April 21 on the State’s policy on providing police protection to health workers, given the attack on health workers, government officials and the police at Padarayanapura ward of Bengaluru city on the night of April 19, when some people were being taken to a quarantine centre.What happenedExplaining the incident at Padarayanapura, which was been sealed and declared a containment zone, the government stated that on April 19, around 6 p.m., health officials of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) and police personnel went to Arafatnagar in the ward. They were assigned the task of securing 58 primary contacts of COVID-19 positive persons for being placed under quarantine and of transporting another 17 persons to be placed in institutional quarantine, under police protection. Around 8 p.m., the government’s statement said, a group led by one Wazeer Khan, unlawfully assembled and started protesting, obstructing the officials from executing their task of transporting another 15 persons to the quarantine centre. “At this stage, the officials pleaded with the crowd to cooperate, since the work they were executing was in the larger interest of the public. However, the pleas of the officials were unheeded and the unlawful assembly started pelting stones, assaulting health officials, BBMP officials, and police personnel,” the government told the court.The mob, according to the statement, also ransacked the temporary sheds constructed for executing duties and proceeded to neighbouring places, causing further destruction of public property and endangering lives and public safety.‘Act swiftly’A special Division Bench comprising Chief Justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice B.V. Nagarathna, taking note of the government’s statement, directed that all police stations be instructed to act immediately whenever there is any need for police protection for healthcare workers on COVID-19 duty. Earlier, the government also said that instructions had been issued to police units to invoke provisions of the National Disaster Management Act, 2006 if anyone obstructed health workers."

All staffers at the district prison — 30 of them — will be quarantined based on the advice of the District Health Officer (DHO), said Alok Mohan, Director-General of Police (Prisons). Family members of the prison staffers vented their anger against the authorities with H.D. Kumaraswamy, the former Chief Minister, who visited prison on Friday. “The staffers were not given any protective gear. They were only given masks and forced to interact with the inmates brought from a COVID-19 affected area in Bengaluru,” they complained. Meanwhile, they also demanded that the staffers have to be quarantined at the staff quarters itself, to which Mr. Kumaraswamy was non-committal. “The modalities of the quarantine process will be decided by the DHO,” said Mr. Mohan. Police officials in the city are also a worried lot. Personnel from J.J. Nagar Police Station and sleuths from the Central Crime Branch, arrested the riot accused who have now tested positive, interrogated them, took them for medical check-up and escorted them to the prison, and all of the have now turned contacts. “Anyone who has come into contact with the positive patient for at least 15 minutes has been categorised as a primary contact,” said a senior police official. There are 32 of them and they are being quarantined. They are presently staying at a police facility, away from their families and will be quarantined by Saturday morning, sources said. “The staff members are a bit worried and naturally are scared as well. But we are trying our best to maintain the morale of the force high,” said Shivaji Rao, inspector, J.J. Nagar, who has not been categorised as a primary contact.Meanwhile, Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai, city Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, Additional Commissioner of Police Soumendu Mukherjee, DCP (West) Ramesh Banoth, and a host of other senior functionaries visited Padarayanapura and J.J. Nagar Police station on Sunday night when the violence broke out and the next morning, when some of those who have now tested positive were at the police station. Deliberations are on with medical authorities whether they would become secondary contacts and what precautions they need to take, sources said."

Sudhakar, in-charge of COVID-19 affairs, that the move to lodge accused from the affected areas in a green zone could have been avoided, only exposed the lack of coordination and left the State government embarrassed. There was palpable anger in Ramanagaram against the State government for lodging the undertrials in the district, as it was in the green zone. In judicial custodyRamanagaram District Prison, with a capacity of 200, was mostly emptied out on Monday and 121 people arrested for violence in Padarayanapura were lodged there. Five of them tested positive for COVID-19 during a medical test conducted by the district administration. “A decision was taken to shift them to a quarantine centre in Bengaluru to ensure the infection doesn’t spread in the district,” said a senior prisons official. Since these persons are either primary or secondary contacts of COVID-19 patients, they were treated as patients in need of medical care and shifted to the quarantine facility on the orders of the district administration. “Prisoners are shifted to hospitals when in need of medical care. They will remain undertrials in judicial custody, but in a hospital, in this case a quarantine facility,” a senior official said. All the 116 of them and 17 other prisoners who were in the Ramanagaram prison were shifted to Haj Bhavan, a government quarantine centre in the city, amid heavy police security and medical precautions on Friday. A fleet of KSRTC buses escorted them to Haj Bhavan. Several dozens of police personnel and healthcare personnel were pressed into service. Wearing of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits was made mandatory for the bus drivers and the police officials.Haj Bhavan was evacuated of others who were under quarantine. “We had 133 people under quarantine in Haj Bhavan, of which 110 finished their quarantine and returned home. Of the remaining 33, two of them tested positive and are being treated in a hospital. Other 31 foreign nationals were shifted to Orchid Resort at Yelahanka on Friday to accommodate persons from Ramanagaram prison,” said Sarfaraz Khan, nodal officer for Haj Bhavan quarantine facility. Containment zone Ramanagaram District Prison will be treated as a containment zone and sanitised, sources in the Prisons Department said. “We have identified 30 staffers at the prison and all of them will be put under quarantine,” said Alok Mohan, Director-General Of Police (Prisons). Mr. Mohan, defended the decision to lodge the undertrials in Ramanagaram district prison, as an administrative call to prevent a larger outbreak among prisoners in the State. The decision was taken by the State-level monitoring committee led by Mr. Mohan formed as per the Supreme Court guidelines on prisons during the pandemic. Since they were arrested in the city, they were supposed to be lodged in Bengaluru Central Prison. “But Bengaluru prison has over 5,000 inmates and lodging these undertrials there would have created a crisis of vast proportions. The Chief Superintendent of Bengaluru Central Prison submitted a memorandum requesting the department not to lodge these undertrials there. He suggested they can be lodged in Ramanagaram prison, also under his supervision. The committee deliberated on the proposal and found it was the best solution on hand and decided on the same,” Mr. Mohan explained. “All care was taken to ensure these undertrials do not come into contact with any other prisoners in the State. The decision was aimed at the larger good,” he said.Ramanagaram prison has a capacity of 200 inmates, but had 177 inmates. Of them 160 were shifted to Bengaluru Central Prison to make space for those from Padarayanapura. However, 17 senior prisoners, who work in the kitchen and other departments of prison administration, were retained. Now, they have also been shifted to the quarantine centre in Bengaluru along with the 116 undertrials."

Over 31 lakh people reside in the buffer zones around the containment zones. At a press conference, Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said that a total of 31.68 lakh people from 6.77 lakh households live in the buffer zones. He also said that a total of 377 patients are tested positive for COVID-19 in the 111 containment zones. Around the containment zones, buffer zones are created by including the area within a 7-km radius and in urban areas, the officials can restrict it to 5 km. Mr. Kumar said the government has banned the movement of people in these zones and the delivery of all essentials will be done at the doorstep of citizens. He also said that these areas would continue to remain as containment zone until no COVID-19 positive case is reported for the next 28-days from the zone. The Minister said that 71 commanders are monitoring these zones and ensuring that there is no movement of people outside their homes. Mr. Kumar said that Bengaluru has 21 containment zones, while Kalaburagi has 16 such and Mysuru 14. All the primary and secondary contacts within the containment zones will be carefully monitored and they must be under home quarantine. The definition of a containment area varies from place to place. A circular states, “If a COVID-19 positive case is found in an apartment complex, then the entire block or apartment tower will be declared a containment zone. If it is a single block apartment, then the entire apartment complex will be declared as containment zone. Similarly, if the COVID-19 patient is found in an independent house or villa, the 100-m radius area, including the street on which the patient’s house is located, will be declared as containment zone.” In the case of slums in urban localities, the entire slum will be declared as containment zone."

She spends a better part of the day doing fieldwork in J.C. Nagar, and other areas in the city where COVID-19 positive cases have been reported. Every day ASHA workers are potentially exposing themselves to the coronavirus as they spend hours in the scorching heat tracing primary and secondary contacts, gathering travel history of residents in a locality and other data. They do this for a fixed monthly honorarium of ₹4,000 and a performance-based incentive. They have been told that they will get an additional incentive of ₹1,000 for carrying out COVID-19 related activities.“We leave home at 9.30 a.m. after wearing a mask and are done by around 2 p.m. We don’t drink water even in the scorching heat as when we are out on the field as there are no washrooms available,” said Ms. Sajidha. On average, they cover 25 houses a day. ASHA workers admit that their work can sometimes be challenging as residents do not cooperate with them, while some of them ask them to return later. “After two attacks on ASHA workers were reported in Bengaluru and Belagavi, the police accompany us when we do surveillance work in some areas,” she added. At the end of the work day, Sajidha returns home to her three children and husband who are worried about her safety. But she puts aside her fear of catching the virus and says, “This is the time that the nation needs our service more than ever before and we are proud to be the warriors fighting the COVID-19 battle,” she said.  ASHA worker Nagalakshmi V., is assigned to Padarayanapura ward which is one of the two wards that has been sealed down by the BBMP. It has been in the news after violence erupted in the area on Sunday. “We have been told not to enter any home and conduct some surveys. Initially, people were reluctant to give us any details and would tell us to go away. But after the ward has been sealed, people are worried and are now asking us questions and talking to us,” she said.D. Nagalakshmi, State Secretary, Karnataka Rajya Samukyta Asha Karkarta Sangha, said that they face several challenges on the field and they are not given adequate masks and sanitisers."

But still some of them are not doing so. If they violate such norms, they will die. Why should we worry about them?” he asked while speaking to reporters in Belagavi.“Doctors and officers have spent a lot of time and energy in explaining the dangers of the disease. They [patients] have been told it is fatal. But they don’t seem to understand. If they continue to violate the rules, they will suffer,” he said. To a question about complaints on keeping all suspected cases in the same hall and some inmates not following quarantine rules, he said the government could not do anything beyond a point. “After all, they should take care of their health. If they die as a result of not following quarantine regulations, let them die. What can we do about it? Why should we bother?” he said angrily. However, he reasoned that the violations were minor and infrequent, as otherwise there would be no recoveries."

At the end of the road, the cluster of sheet houses where nearly 200 migrant workers lived is deserted. On Friday, the number of COVID-19 positive cases stood at 21 within the community of migrant workers, most of whom hailed from Bihar. Health Department officials are trying to ascertain the source of the virus in patient 419. The patient was reportedly working at a construction site in Mangammanapalya. Sources said the building owner is absconding. The BBMP, which has cordoned off a 100-150 metre radius around the cluster, is conducting a survey of pregnant and lactating women, senior citizens and those suffering from chronic ailments.

The Dakshina Kannada district administration had also decided not to entertain medical emergencies from Kasaragod district following a huge number of COVID-19 positive cases being reported in that district. The State government, on March 30, invoked the provisions of The Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, to support its move.The Supreme Court intervened following a batch of petitions and ensured both States agreed on the movement of medical emergencies from Kasaragod district to Mangaluru, as per some agreed terms, on April 7.Border demarcationWhen the Kerala police erected a check-post about 100 metres from Karnataka’s check-post on NH 66 at Talapady village on Thursday, the Talapady Gram Panchayat objected to it, saying the area belonged to it.A joint survey was taken up to determine the border and it was found that the location of the check-post was actually in Kerala, said Mangaluru Assistant Commissioner C. Madan Mohan.Mangaluru Police Commissioner P.S. Harsha told The Hindu both the States have been ensuring strict lockdown at the border area. Movement of members of the general public is allowed only as per the agreed upon protocol, including medical emergencies, births and deaths. The city police have installed eight CCTV cameras at their check-post. It is also connected to the Kerala police, Dr. Harsha said, adding that there was absolute transparency.‘Heated’ atmospherePrakash Manjeshwar, a reporter with a Kannada daily working in Mangaluru and a resident of Manjeshwar in Kerala, said the border appeared like an international border, with police on both sides turning away people to the other side. “The atmosphere has become heated,” he said."

673,Karnataka,"April 25, 2020 22:38 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,Coronavirus | Bengal families stranded in Bengaluru,"Several families who travelled to Bengaluru from West Bengal last month seeking medical treatment find themselves stranded in hotels and paying guest accommodations due to the lockdown. With money running out, they are finding it tough to make ends meet. While the city police are ready to issue passes to enable them to return home by road, the cost of hiring private transport — including in some cases, necessarily, only ambulances — is too steep for most to afford. Arnab Kumar Ghosh, a Ph.D student and a resident of Malda district, came with his family on March 13 for his father’s cancer treatment and has been stuck here ever since. “We are living in a hotel, paying a daily rent of ₹800. We are also forced to buy food. Money is running out, and the situation is grim,” he told The Hindu. Aktar Mondal, a resident of Bongaon, came here with four members of his family for treatment on March 18 and was scheduled to return on March 25. “I had booked the ticket, but a lockdown was announced the previous night. Again I booked tickets when the first phase was supposed to end, but again I lost money as the lockdown was extended,” he said. “Police said they would facilitate our return if we arranged for transport, which we cannot afford now,” he said.‘Money running out’Bimal Kashyap from Darjeeling, who came to Bangaluru for getting medical attention for his father-in-law’s cancer, said, “Some of them [other families that have come for treatment] are in a pretty bad condition, stranded here with no money.” This group of five families, stuck in a hotel near Narayana Health City, even approached the city police for help. While the police reasoned with the hotel management and even succeeded in getting them a rebate on the room rent, the hotel, however, rolled it back after a few days, making it a very brief relief.The State government has issued orders to the police to book cases against landlords if they harass or evict tenants during the lockdown. However, the order covers only residences and paying guest accommodation and not hotels. Police have booked cases against landlords of guest houses and PG accommodations.Tapan Chowdhary, a native of Bardhaman, came to the city on March 18 for a family member’s treatment and was staying at a guest house when he ran out of money. When the landlord insisted on the rent and warned that failure to pay would require him to vacate, he approached the police. The Kadugodi police booked a case and arrested two members of the management of the guest house. There are over six cases registered in the Whitefield division alone, but all against guest houses and PG accommodations, not hotels.‘Costs involved’“We also have to keep the establishment running and that involves costs,” said a local hotelier, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “We are not able to manage if the occupants do not pay up,” he added.Sagar Chowdhary, also from West Bengal, came on March 18 for availing treatment for his father’s renal failure and has been stranded ever since. He ran out of money to even buy rations and is now dependent on relief from the government and NGOs. “Since we stay in hotels, relief workers assume we are well off and we do not figure on their priority list. But a kilo of puffed rice is sold for ₹120 here. How can we afford it?”COVID Genie, a group of mostly Bengali speaking volunteers, however, reached out to help him.Southeast Bengaluru serves as a hub of private hospitals, many of which attract patients from other States including West Bengal. “We have identified hundreds of families making up to over a thousand members stuck in various hotels in this area and several at hospitals as well,” said a member of the COVID Genie team, declining to be identified. “We are concentrating our efforts on them. Many have run out of money and are in need of rations. They would also need a helping hand to return home once the lockdown is lifted,” the volunteer added. There is no official data on how many such families are stranded in the city.While those cases that need emergency medical care are mostly being attended to, those who have come here for elective surgeries find that the surgeries have been rescheduled as hospitals are prioritising the fight against COVID-19. “Some of them have issues in procuring medicine, some may not be available at the local chemists while others also face a funds crunch. We are also trying to help them. But the need is much more than what we are able to cater to,” the COVID Genie team member observed."

The five people, shunted from location to location, are part of the group of 32 foreigners who had been arrested for violating visa norms and were originally quarantined at Haj Bhavan. Some of them had been shifted from Haj Bhavan to hotels on Ballari Road in Yelahanka that had been identified as quarantine centres. According to officials, this was done to accommodate more cases. “However, on Friday night, Yelahanka constituency MLA S.R. Vishwanath and other locals staged a protest over their presence at the hotel in Yelahanka and demanded that they be shifted out,” said a senior officer. The group were then taken to a service apartment in Kacharakanahalli ward, Banaswadi. However when word spread, hundreds started protesting. On Saturday morning, Kacharakanahalli councillor Padmanabha Reddy and local residents staged a protest in front of the Banaswadi police station, and demanded that they be taken back to the Haj Bhavan.“The attendees, most of whom are foreign nationals, were earlier quarantined in Haj Bhavan. They were suddenly shifted to a service apartment in a purely residential colony in Banaswadi. The residents were afraid of contracting COVID-19,” said Mr. Reddy. Protesters alleged that the area is densely populated and the presence of the five people would increase their chances of getting infected. “We withdrew the protest only after assurance from BBMP that they would be shifted from there. They were taken away from the service apartment in two vans around 3 p.m. on Saturday,” Mr. Reddy added.Senior police officials have written a letter to the Foreigner’s Regional Registration Officer on Saturday. They further requested the FRRO to issue the instructions to jurisdictional Ramamurthy Nagar police station to provide security/protection to these foreign national Tablighi Jamaat members.

After almost a month, the Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) has resumed Phase II of Namma Metro work at 45 locations in the city. On Friday night, nearly 1,350 construction workers reported back to work.Metro workers wearing masks were seen doing various works such as track linking, viaduct launching and shuttering work on the elevated line between IIM-B and Hulimavu metro station. The demolition of Jayadeva flyover and work in casting yards has also begun.“Our people have also started preliminary works of assembling tunnel boring machines recently imported from China. No works have been taken in any work sites that come under containment zones declared by the BBMP,” said a BMRCL official. Like other agencies in the city, after the lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of COVID-19, BMRCL had stopped construction and other related work, but is probably the first agency in the city to resume work before restrictions are lifted on May 3. Managing Director Ajay Seth said that measures have been put in place on the sites to ensure that people working there can maintain physical distance from each other. This also includes mandatory temperature checks. “Wherever it is convenient to resume the work, we have done that,” said Mr. Seth.Ensuring that precautionary measures are being followed is not the only challenge that the metro rail corporation is facing. “We are also facing certain limitations such as the supply chains for cement, steel and other raw materials are not fully operational. We have taken these factors into consideration,” he added. Another 7,000 workers are on standby. “We may need a couple more days to put everything in place, after which the required number of people will be deployed at the sites.” The year 2020 is crucial for the BMRCL as it has a deadline to commission commercial operations of extended metro lines on Kanakapura Road (August 15) and Mysuru Road (November1). The BMRCL is hoping to make up for lost time.When asked whether the pandemic would affect deadlines, a senior BMRCL official said it was too early to comment on whether the lockdown would affect deadlines for the completion of the underground line and other elevated lines. “We have resumed work now by taking a lot of precautions. It will take some to assess how they will progress, after which we can draw some conclusions on deadlines, but not now,” said the official. Flyover demolition during the dayThe demolition of Jayadeva flyover resumed on Friday night. The agency is planning to carry out demolition work during the day as well to advance completion.

Minajagi helplessly looks at the betel leaves turning from green to brown on his 10-acre plot. He has incurred a loss of over ₹2 lakh a month from his farm, located at Kudgi village in the district, and has no idea when his misery will end.All betel leaf growers are facing a peculiar problem during the lockdown. They are unable to sell their produce even though their produce falls under the category of horticultural crop. “The government has announced that there is no restriction on the transportation of agricultural and horticultural crop. But since betel leaves are not considered essential commodities, we neither have buyers nor consumers,” he said. Kudgi is known for cultivating betel leaves supplied to many major cities in South India and Maharashtra.Noor Ahmed Dafedar, another grower, said the lockdown has hit hundreds of labourers involved in packing and transportation, earning around ₹500 a day, which is high among agricultural labourers.“Most of the leaves are directly consumed by people as they buy them from paan shops. Some of it also used at weddings and festivals. Now, as paan shops are closed and public functions are banned, our primary source of revenue has collapsed,” Mr. Dafedar said. Some philanthropists are purchasing fruits from farmers and directly giving them to consumers, but betel leaf growers cannot hope for any such help either. Santosh Inamdar, Deputy Director of Horticulture, admitted that betel leaf growers were in a peculiar situation. “The leaves cannot be kept in cold storage for days as they are not fit for that. Since it is not an essential commodity, it cannot be sold directly. Therefore, nothing much can be done except to wait for the lockdown to end,” he said."

One of the victims, Chand Pasha, 35, approached the Varthur police stating that the landlord assaulted him, his room-mate and the neighbours, including a pregnant woman who had come to their rescue.Pasha, who was employed with a car cleaning unit at Marathahalli for the past six years, shared a room with Yakub Sheikh for which they paid ₹4,000 as rent to the landlord, Manje Gowda. He owns 60 sheds on a plot of land that he rents, said the police. Owing to the lockdown, Pasha has been unable to work.On April 24, Manje Gowda, along with his associates, barged into the camp and ransacked their premises demanding that they pay the rent. Pasha and Sheikh tried to reason with him and said they had no money, but the landlord beat them up. “He threatened to kill them if they did not vacate the premises,” the police said.On Sunday, Manje Gowda and his associates returned and abused the duo for not vacating the shed. When their neighbours tried to intervene, the accused assaulted them too. Following the incident, several labourers from neighbouring areas started gathering at the spot. “Where should we go during the lockdown? The police have told us that we need not pay rent and that the owners can’t demand it, but this harassment continues,” residents said. The Varthur police have taken up a case and deployed police personnel in the area to monitor the law and order situation. The police have registered a case and are tracking down Manje Gowda who is on the run."

However, many companies that had promised stipends are now telling the students that they will not be paid any amount.The manager of a private company said, “We get a lot of interns during the summer. Most of them are pursuing MBA and they bring a fresh perspective to work. This normally helps both the company as well as the students. But now with the online internship, it may be difficult to recreate the same experience,” he said. Some companies are also choosing not to take interns as a lot of their information and software are confidential. But some others are trying to make it a seamless experience for their interns and have even conducted virtual induction sessions and are asking for mentors for each of them. Abraham V.M., Vice-Chancellor, Christ University, said that students were asked to work from home and continue their internship. “If the companies don’t offer the internship virtually, we have asked students to look for internship in other companies,” he said. Students have been told by the colleges to take internship even though companies are unable to honour the offers that they made. “We have cut the salaries of our employees in the range of 10 to 30% based on their salary structure. It is a testing time for us and our company’s financial health makes it impossible for us to pay interns. Interns who have already been made offers were promised a monthly stipend of ₹20,000. As we will not be able to pay them, they can feel free to cancel their internship,” said the HR manager of a start-up in east Bengaluru.Students whose internship solely rely on hands-on experience have been told to put the same off for now. “Our department told us that we can do out mandatory internship during the October break if we can’t right now. Most of our internships are hands-on, so we’ll most probably do them in October,” a student of the Department of Communication Studies, Mount Carmel College, said."

684,Karnataka,"April 28, 2020 20:06 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,COVID-19: Poor financial health of hospitals leads to pay cut for doctors,"Several private hospitals in the city that have stopped elective surgeries and are focussing only on emergency cases are struggling to pay salaries to their staff, including doctors. Most are functioning at less than 20% of their patient capacity. While some hospital boards have asked a section of their doctors to take leave with loss of pay, others said both doctors and administrative staff have volunteered to take pay cuts. R. Ravindra, president of the Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association, which has close to 400 hospitals in the city, said they have instructed their hospitals to ensure that they do not lay off or cut salaries of their nursing and housekeeping staff. “Hospitals are currently seeing patients in the range of 10% to 20% of their total capacity. Many of the specialists are freelancers and get paid based on the patients they treat. They come if there are patients. Since they do not have patients, they have not been coming,” he said. Doctors involved in COVID-19 duties are being paid on time without any pay cut. Vikram Sreeram, managing director of Mallige Hospital, admitted that it was indeed difficult times for hospitals. “We have adopted two strategies for our doctors. While some doctors will have to take a pay cut, we have told senior consultants that their salaries will be deferred,” he said. The salary cut for doctors ranges from 30% to 50%, based on their salary slabs. “Our occupancy is only 15%. We are taking only emergency cases on an outpatient basis.” Mr. Vikram also said that some senior doctors have been requested not to report to work.Some hospitals have told their staff that the salary cuts would be applicable for the next three months, after which the situation would be reviewed based on the trajectory of the pandemic. In a circular, Vydehi Institute of Medical Sciences has requested the staff to forego an amount equivalent to 12 days’ pay. This is not applicable to staff members drawing less than ₹20,000 a month, which includes paramedical, support, and nursing staff. Temporary shutdownExplaining the effect of the lockdown and the pandemic on their financial health, Dr. Ravindra said that some of the smaller hospitals, including ENT and eye hospitals, have shut down temporarily. “We are getting reports of some hospitals having less than five patients,” he said. At the same time, hospitals are incurring costs on procuring PPE kits and sanitisers, and are spending on other precautionary measures. The association has asked the State government if some of their outgoings for utilities, including electricity bill, can be deferred for the next couple of months. For some doctors, the salary cut is going to make life difficult, but is unavoidable. “Our hospital is requesting us to accept a pay cut. I am the sole breadwinner of my family. Though we have the same bills to pay as earlier, I have no option but to accept the decision of the management,” a doctor said."

The Centre’s scheduled lockdown ends on Sunday.This means industrial activities are expected to resume in industrial estates, industrial parks and SEZs in Bengaluru and other major cities from Monday. Only industries that are located in containment zones in urban areas are not allowed to function from Monday. Public transport, however, will continue to stay off the road for the time being.Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa cautioned that the COVID-19 crisis may last another two to three months. “But we feel that the cases are reducing and coming under control in the State. In Bengaluru, not many cases have been reported in the last three to four days. If this continues, it will help us to open industries in and around Bengaluru,” he told presspersons after chairing a Cabinet meeting.“Based on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s directions, stringent lockdown measures in red zones and reviving economic activity will go hand in hand,” Mr. Yediyurappa said.A couple of days ago, the government permitted industries in rural areas of 14 districts to start production. The Cabinet meeting today permitted all types of industries in rural and urban areas, except those in containment zones, to commence production from Monday.However, barber shops, hotels, malls, cinemas, and all modes of mass transport continue to remain closed.

Yet, the 14 employees were allegedly commuting daily from their respective homes in Mysuru to Chamarajanagar through Banahalli check-post.Sources said in addition to violation of the directives it tantamouts to exposing themselves and others to the danger of contracting the virus.This has been viewed seriously as Chamarajanagar is green zone and is among the handful of districts in Karnataka where not a single COVID-19 positive case has been reported while the adjoining Mysuru is in red zone owing to the outbreak at the Nanjangud pharma company.With their intransigence, these employees had not only risked exposing themselves to the virus but also put others at risk, according to the authorities.It is common for government officials posted in Chamarajanagar to commute daily to and from Mysuru during normal times. “But this is a pandemic to combat which the government is waging a protracted battle and imposed a lockdown, and that necessitated the presence of all officials in their respective station of posting,” said a senior official in the administration."

Venkatesh, however, said that no protocols were violated and there was no need to be alarmed.The 53-year-old Padavapura native, who had been residing in Mumbai for 15 years, died at the V.N. Desai Government Hospital at Santacruz on April 23. His embalmed body was brought to the district on April 24. The cremation was held under the supervision of personnel deputed on COVID-19 duty.The daughter, 24, son-in-law, 25, and grandson, 2, of the deceased who accompanied the body from Mumbai (P-566, P-567, and P-568, respectively), and his second daughter staying in K.R.

Amidst the relaxation of certain restrictions during the extension of lockdown, the city administration is hoping that this measure will help curb the spread of COVID-19.People are required to wear masks in all public spaces and in workspaces with more than five persons in the city. Violators may end up not just paying a penalty, but also with a criminal cases against them. The police, who have been entrusted with the enforcement, can book cases under Sections 269 and 270 of the Indian Penal Code for a negligent and malignant act leading to spread of the infection, respectively. Senior police officials said that criminal cases will be booked only in extreme cases where there is a resistance to the enforcement of the rule. Bengaluru is one of the last metros to make this mandatory, following Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Chennai. Mysuru recently mandated wearing masks and also announced a penalty of ₹100 for violation. Health surveyMeanwhile, a universal household health survey, for Severe Acute Respiratory Illness (SARI) and other COVID-19 like symptoms, will begin on May 5, with the aim of identifying potential cases for testing. Bengaluru [with 138 positive cases] has fared relatively well in checking the spread of the disease compared to other metro cities in India. Civic Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said the city was gearing up to the challenge of easing certain restrictions in non-containment zones — like opening standalone shops, restarting of industry — from May 4. “We are working based on projections of nearly 4,800 odd cases in Bengaluru Urban by the month-end,” he said, but was quick to add it was only a theoretical projection. “Several SARI cases are turning positive for COVID-19 which is a cause of concern. Making wearing masks mandatory and a health survey being initiated are both aimed to prevent a spike in cases. It’s a preventive measure,” he said. The survey to be conducted is expected to be completed in five days. However, it will depend on how many teachers turn up for the training session to be held on Saturday and be part of the survey. Mr. Kumar has issued an order making it mandatory for teachers to be part of the health survey and that A failure to turn up for the training and survey will be considered a violation of the Epidemic Act, 1897. In an order, Mr. Kumar stipulated that masks and gloves have to be properly handed over to waste collectors in covers or closed bags as part of sanitary waste. Spitting, urinating and littering of any kind will also be considered a public offence."

The task force will compulsorily meet once in two days to take appropriate decisions on the grievances to be filed by workers. This is in addition to the Labour Wage and Retrenchment COVID Helpline that has been receiving grievances related to salary and retrenchment over the past fortnight.The task force comes in the light of demand by trade unions to have an institutional mechanism to prevent wage cuts and retrenchment, and a U-turn made by the State government, apparently under pressure from industry bodies, on a Labour Department’s directive to industries not to cut wages or retrench workers. Incidentally, the Union government had on March 28 issued a directive to States to protect wages for the lockdown period and jobs of workers in the industries.No statutory powersWelcoming the setting up of the task force, AITUC general secretary D.A. Vijaybhaskar told The Hindu that though the task force does not have any statutory powers, it is still a good move considering that the industry expects many factories to fold up. “It can see whether the permission to close is on a genuine ground. Otherwise, when businesses close in big numbers, tracing the owner becomes difficult and workers may be left in the lurch. It can function as a joint body to mitigate the suffering of the workforce,” he added."

The district has been placed in the green zone and certain lockdown curbs have been relaxed, including those on construction activities.Even as construction of houses for flood victims had picked up pace, the administration has proposed to hand over completed houses to the affected families before the monsoon sets in.Also, officials are in the process of identifying areas vulnerable to floods and landslips based on the data sourced from the Geological Survey of India (GSI) and also the data collated from previous tragedies. Minister for Housing V. Somanna recently inspected the houses and asked the engineers to complete them by monsoon.The administration, in 2019, had estimated ₹1,700 crore for rebuilding Kodagu after the calamities.

Task cut out Until August-September, key department officials will have their task cut out and cannot loosen up with multitasks on their hands, with the additional role of combating the pandemic.When contacted, Assistant Commissioner Jaware Gowda said the construction of houses for flood victims at Galibeedu and K. Nidaguni was under way and the work had not stopped during lockdown. Work was continuing with limited number of workers who were maintaining social distance. Now, the work had been expedited by employing more workers with strict social distancing and safety norms in place.In the meantime, monsoon preparedness has commenced on the lines of 2019 which helped the authorities to counter the rain havoc better and minimise losses. The tourism economy was badly hit because of two back-to-back tragedies. This year, much ahead of the monsoon, COVID-19 pandemic badly affected the tourism sector.Sources told The Hindu that the teams that worked during last two years had been continued for the monsoon tasks and entrusted with counter mission. “Identification of elderly persons, pregnant women, people living in remote hilly areas and in isolated homes and so on was being done and they will be shifted to safer places,” a source said.To be relocatedAlso, the administration has proposed to entirely relocate the affected families living illegally close to river banks to obviate sufferings similar to those undergone in 2018 and 2019. The administration has identified government land in five villages for relocating 237 affected families who were living in temporary dwellings close to the river banks and most of the dwelling had been destroyed in the floods."

KVK has taken the help of WhatsApp groups and has been successful in linking sellers and buyers. After Suresh Nayak, who had grown watermelons on 13 acres of his field in Munduje in Udupi district, found it difficult to market his produce due to lockdown, KVK publicised it on the WhatsApp groups. Soon, Mr. Nayak began getting calls from buyers in different places and also in Udupi city asking for watermelons. As a result, he sold 200 tonnes of the crop. “The buyers came to my field and purchased it,” he said. This facilitation process has helped farmers from other districts also. Vasanthakumari, a farmer from Katanayakanahalli in Chitradurga district, had grown 10 tonnes of onions in her field. Unable to sell them, she expressed her distress on social media. Officers of the Department of Horticulture, Chitradurga, got in touch with KVK who in turn contacted Mr. Nayak and asked him if he would purchase the onions. Mr. Nayak purchased 172 sacks, containing 60 kgs onions each, at ₹550 per sack, though it normally sells for ₹250 per sack. Ms. Vasanthakumari thanked Mr. Nayak for purchasing the onions, and Chaitanya H.S., horticulture scientist at KVK, Brahmavar, for helping her.Mr. Nayak said that owing to the facilitation by the KVK he had also purchased different vegetables grown by farmers in other districts and had been selling it here for wholesale prices. “This facilitation is helping the farmers as they do not have to search for buyers and the customers also get vegetables and fruits at cheaper rates,” he said. “Our only aim is to help farmers find markets for their produce,” said Mr. Chaitanya."

697,Karnataka,"May 02, 2020 21:23 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,"Despite initiative from hospitals, not many takers for telemedicine","The lockdown, during which patients have been told to visit hospitals and clinics only in cases of emergency, has prompted several hospitals to start telemedicine consultations. However, the demand for telemedicine is still low and many patients are instead deferring consultations to the post-lockdown period. R. Ravindra, president, Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes’ Association (PHANA), Karnataka, said there was a need for the medical fraternity to promote telemedicine more aggressively. “Patients want to meet the doctor in person and want the doctor to physically examine them. But most lifestyle diseases and chronic ailments do not always require physical examination and can be treated via online consultation,” he said. He also urged patients not to put off getting advice from a doctor beyond a point. “We are seeing that many are delaying visits and are coming to hospitals in serious condition. Sometimes, simple interventions such as prescribing a drug will go a long way in ensuring that the patient’s health improves,” he said. Vikram Sreeram, MD, Mallige Hospital, said they started video consultations around three weeks ago. “We have seen only a small number of patients signing up for this. Our assessment is that patients are more comfortable with a face-to-face interaction with doctors,” he said. S. Murali, chief of Clinical Services and consultant neurologist at Manipal Hospitals, said that around a third of their regular patients are opting for telemedicine, but the trend is promising. “Telemedicine cannot be a replacement for personal consultation and is only complementary to it,” he said. “It is also ideal for the elderly, who are vulnerable and have been told to avoid stepping out.” Patients are not yet completely convinced about telemedicine. Shruthi Rao, a software professional, said she opted for an online consultation after she sprained her leg. Not very happy with her experience, she said, “Instead of opting for another telemedicine session, I will go personally and meet a doctor.” She admitted, however, that there were some benefits to telemedicine, including saving waiting time."

However as holding the bottle of sanitiser itself has become a bit risky, the engineering students from KLE Technological University, Hubballi, have devised a simple technique to make it automatic. Karthik V.R., Abhilash G., Vinayak, Praveen, Santosh and Abilash K. have designed the automatic sanitiser dispenser unit which is sensor-based. The students said that as it would be difficult for doctors and nurses, serving in isolation wards to use the sanitiser without touching the bottle, they thought of developing an automatich dispenser. As the new unit operates on sensor, the doctors and nurses will not have to touch or press it. They place their hand below the nozzle and the unit will automatically dispense a stipulated amount of the sanitiser, they said.The students were guided by Ravi Guttal of KLE Technological University and S.V. Mulkimath of KIMS. The students recently handed over the sanitiser unit to Director of KIMS Ramalingappa Antaratani for use at the KIMS isolation ward. Minister for Large and Medium Industries Jagadish Shettar and Deputy Commisioner of Dharwad Deepa M. have lauded the students’ innovation."

In an appeal to the Chief Minister B.S.

Shops with these two licences have been allowed to open from Monday with some restrictions. “Only standalone shops are allowed to open.

During the lockdown period, the State reported a loss of over ₹2,500 crore in excise revenue. On Saturday, the government permitted wine stores, MSIL outlets, distilleries, breweries, and wineries outside containment zones to reopen from Monday.While there were reports of people already standing in queue in front of liquor outlets at several places on Sunday, federation sources said that it was wary of less than half of the total liquor licensees being allowed to open shop. “Of the nearly 11,000 liquor licences in the State, holders of about 4,500 will open shop on Monday.

As of May 3, as many as 839 people are being quarantined in 15 different centres across the city. Waste from quarantine facilities is deemed as biomedical waste. Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) D. Randeep said that the civic body had tied up with four biomedical waste management agencies, which have been given the work order for one month. “Since all the four are authorised biomedical waste management agencies, as per Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) guidelines, the rates can be decided mutually by the urban local bodies (BBMP in this instance) and the agencies,” he said and added that the payment for each agency will be within ₹1 lakh.According to data, around 155 kg of waste is collected from the 15 quarantine facilities every day. Most of the incineration facilities are on the city’s outskirts. Since the quarantine facilities were set up, a total of 1,409.95 kg of waste (as on May 3) had been incinerated, the data shows.The Biomedical Waste Management Rules, 2016, state that waste should be put in yellow coloured, non-chlorinated plastic bags. Once collected, these bags and their contents must either be incinerated or buried deep in a pit at a common biomedical treatment facility.

It is treated as any other sanitary waste.Given the situation, the BBMP is not insisting on a strict implementation of the plastic ban, either in the quarantine facilities or by those under home quarantine. “We have requested those under home quarantine to keep wet waste separately.

713,Karnataka,"May 06, 2020 00:16 IST",Karnataka,MYSURU,Tackling rural distress and retaining green zone status,"A few out-of-the-box initiatives in Chamarajanagar district has helped continuation of farm-based activities to reduce rural distress during lockdown while ensuring that its status as a green zone is not affected. Chamarajanagar is among the nearly 10 districts in the State where not a single COVID-19 positive case has been recorded as on date. But it is also one of the most backward districts of the State where agriculture is the only source of occupation for the bulk of the labour force.Hence, the challenge before the authorities was do a balancing act of ensuring farm-based employment to reduce rural distress while maintaining social distancing to reduce the possibility of virus spread. A key element for agriculture is the timely availability of seeds, farm implements, and fertiliser much of which is distributed through the Raitha Samparka Kendras (RSK).There are 16 RSKs in Chamarajanagar where agricultural activity is not only primary source of occupation but also the only sector that absorbs the bulk of the labour force. “We realised that activating the RSKs will result in overcrowding at these centres and neutralise the gains of lockdown and social distancing. Chamarajanagar comes under green zone with not a single COVID-19 positive case and this had to be maintained. Besides, it was impossible for farmers to commute to reach the RSKs in the absence of transportation,” said M.R. Ravi, Deputy Commissioner of Chamarajanagar.So the functioning of the RSKs was decentralised and its role replicated by the 84 primary agricultural cooperative societies (PACS) that are located at all hobli and gram panchayat levels. “As a result, the RSKs became redundant because seeds, fertilizer, and other materials were now being distributed through the PACS that helped maintain the momentum in agriculture,” said Mr. Ravi.Agriculture across Chamarajanagar takes place mainly under rainfed conditions and the district received copious rains in the last week of March and the first week of April. It was imperative to kickstart agricultural activity as any delay would have affected sowing which has to be completed by May 31. Groundnut, sunflower, bajra, black gram, and green gram, apart from vegetables and fruits are cultivated in the district.Thanks to the availability of seeds and fertilizer, sowing activity has gained momentum. “Against a target of completing sowing across 55,000 hectares of land for the early kharif crops, sowing has been completed in 15,000 hectares,” said Mr. Ravi. During the dry season when farming activity is near non-existent, agricultural-related activities were initiated under the MGNREGA and 1.03 lakh mandays of jobs were created. This entailed clearing weeds on the tank bundhs, dredging of waterbodies and other activities which helped provide sustainable employment in rural areas. Despite the initiatives, the underlying challenge of retaining the green status of the district, was preponderant among the officials. Hence amid all the activities, random screening of workers with COVID-19 symptoms or anyone who need to be isolated, was not given up."
714,Karnataka,"May 08, 2020 00:01 IST",Karnataka,Bengaluru,"On final day of free services for migrants, KSRTC operates 185 bus services","The free bus service by Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC) for migrants who wanted to return to their home towns in other parts of Karnataka ended on Thursday. The KSRTC operated 185 buses and ferried around 5,500 people to 43 destinations on the day.In all, from May 3, the KSRTC has operated 3,610 buses, transporting around 1.1 lakh people to over 75 destinations for free. From Bengaluru alone, it operated 2,288 buses, facilitating the transportation of around 70,000 people. Shivayogi C. Kalasad, MD of KSRTC, said that the first three days saw the highest number of operations as the demand was high. “On May 4 alone, we operated around 800 buses; it was around 500 buses each on May 3 and 5,” he said.Mr. Kalasad also said they had observed a sharp decrease in the number of people travelling from Bengaluru city in the past two days. “The easing of COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in the city might have prompted some workers to stay back,” he said."
715,Karnataka,"May 07, 2020 23:55 IST",Karnataka,Bengaluru,"In Karnataka, government relief brings little cheer to most migrant workers","Workers at a Nayandahalli labour colony have stayed put there for a month, fighting the urge to somehow get back home. Out of work and out of money, they did not want to leave without getting paid. “It has been five months since we got paid by the builder. We have even filed a police complaint. There are about 250 of us stuck in the colony, depending on government ration and unable to go home or lead a decent life by getting paid for the work we put in,” said Anang, who is from Odisha. The State government’s relief announcement for construction workers — a one-time payment of ₹5,000 — does not bring cheer to Anang and many like him, who are not registered workers. Some builders started the process of registration only recently — a measure, workers say, that is too little, too late. “Yesterday, they were distributing forms for registration. On the one hand, there are pending dues. On the other, the registration process will take time when they have started doing it only now. We just want to go home after getting our dues. We no longer can bear this,” he said. Trade unions also said Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa’s relief measures for construction workers might do little for the vast majority, comprising mainly migrant workers who are not even aware of the need to register. Counting workersN. Shivanna, general secretary of the State construction workers’ union affiliated to the All-India Trade Union Congress, said that as of February-end, there were around 21.7 lakh construction workers registered. “But it won’t be surprising if the actual number is double this, as a majority of migrant workers are not covered. In fact, many from Karnataka may not have registered.” N.P. Samy, president, Karnataka State Construction Workers’ Central Union, said, “There is also the issue of MGNREGA workers, who partly do construction work, being included, raising the total number. Of those who engage only in construction work full time, many migrants are not registered as they move constantly,” he said. He also pointed out that it may take time for the relief to reach beneficiaries, given the sheer number and logistics involved. Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Association of India (CREDAI) chairman Kishore Jain, who is a member of the Karnataka Building and Other Construction Workers’ Welfare Board, said the labour cess fund belongs to construction workers and efforts were being made to ensure that it reached them, and not the middlemen. “Labourer attrition rate is very high. So registration is a continuous process. We have also suggested a shramik card like Aadhaar so it benefits anyone who is a construction worker, irrespective of where they move to,” he said.But the priority for many at present is not monetary help. A worker from Konanakunte, who is a native of Jharkhand, said, “They got us registered yesterday though we came in January. But I just want to go home. Money is not what I want now.”"
716,Karnataka,"May 07, 2020 23:50 IST",Karnataka,Bengaluru,The long march home on the other side of Vindhyas,"Thousands of migrant workers from the city, a majority of them young men in their 20s and 30s, have begun the long march home to Uttar Pradesh and other States in North India. Though the State government on Thursday announced that it would restart the Shramik Express trains to the northern States, they have not turned back to Bengaluru. National Highway 44 is dotted with small groups of people, their faces covered in handkerchiefs or masks, carrying luggage and bottles of water. Despite facing several challenges on the road — uncertainty over their next meal, the soaring mercury, and difficulty in crossing borders — their resolve to reach home remains firm. Mohammed Naushad, 28, who sold readymade garments on the pavements of Majestic, began his journey home towards Bhagpat district, Uttar Pradesh, early on Thursday morning. “We have waited long enough for the lockdown to end and for a seat on a train home. We have had enough of the government, so we decided to walk home,” he said.But is it feasible to walk home that far? “We have Googled and know that we have to cover over 2,300 km to reach home in Gorakhpur. But this is the only way. It will take a few weeks, but we will definitely get there,” said Rajesh Paswan, 31, a painter. Most of them plan to walk early in the morning, rest in the afternoon, and resume late in the night to avoid the summer heat. Amit Kumar, 31, a carpenter walking to Sonbhadra district in U.P., said they were aware that some of them could even die on the way home. “But it is better to die on the road home than to die of hunger in this city,” he said, as he broke down. Their hope is to reach Hyderabad, where they believe they can catch trains to Uttar Pradesh. “If not, we will continue our walk from there as well. More people will join us,” said Ram Lal, a native of Gorakhpur. Though the State government has said economic activities will begin, the migrant workers don’t seem to care. “There has been no work for over a month now. Our contractors haven’t paid us anything. Help stopped coming by after May 3 when government announced work can begin. But there is no work. We started running out of money and, despite our best efforts, could not find a ticket on a train home. The landlord began pestering us for rent. We decided to leave before we ran out of all our money,” said Ravi Pratap Singh, a painter.Another painter, Adarsh Rav, 19, carried with him a bucket he used to mix paint and a bag of clothes — his only belongings. He has ₹700 on him for the long journey home. Most of the people The Hindu spoke to had less than ₹1,000 with them. Many have received money deposited in their accounts through mobile payment gateways from their families back home. Wherever possible, they hitched rides on goods vehicles plying on the highway, sometimes paying for it. A group of nine workers from Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, working in Mandya, walked beyond Chickballapur and hitched a ride to Anantapur in a tempo. “While some drivers ask for money, some give us free rides out of kindness. We have spent nearly ₹500 each for rides in our journey so far,” said Nouman Tyagi.Border closureThe authorities have been trying to get the workers off the roads, but to little effect. The Karnataka police rounded up nearly 300 workers walking on NH 44 late on Wednesday night and housed them in two marriage halls at Kodigehalli, where they are being given meals.Meanwhile, the Andhra Pradesh police have erected a check-post at Chilamathur in Anantapur district, where they are not allowing any migrant workers on foot to enter the State. T. Venkateshwarulu, sub-inspector, Chilamathur police, manning the check-post, said they were sending back the migrant workers back towards Karnataka. However, those who seek to walk back home over 2,000 km are not to be deterred by such hurdles. “There will obviously be other routes through the villages to bypass the check-post on the highway. Will the policemen be there even at night?” asked Mr. Ram Lal. What seems to be keeping these workers going is the small acts of kindness from strangers. Ramesh Singh, who was walking with a group of 10 or so persons, was stopped by a biker on Wednesday night. Learning of their journey home, the biker gave each of them ₹1,000 and said this was all he could do at that time. Anji, who works with a private firm, distributed free meals to those on foot along the highway on Thursday afternoon. “I work with a company whose owner sent me on this mission to help these poor people,” he said. While thankful for these acts, what the workers eagerly look forward to is any vehicle that can offer them a lift."

Nearly 300 of them, who began their walk on Wednesday but were detained by the police and housed in two choultries at Kodigehalli, left for Uttar Pradesh on a train on Friday evening.“We had given up hope, but the government has shown some mercy at last. I find it hard to believe that I will actually reach home in three days,” said an elated Chanchal, 29, a carpenter from Gorakhpur district of Uttar Pradesh, speaking to The Hindu from the train.Still on footNot all labourers, however, have stopped their trek back home. Several new groups of labourers began their walk home on Friday, despite knowing that the trains have restarted. “We spent nearly a week to register online. We don’t trust that we will get a train ticket any time soon,” said Mohammed Asgar, 31, a plumber from Sarangpur, Uttar Pradesh. He was detained by the police on the highway as he was walking home and said he was biding his time to restart his walk after nightfall.Girish Chand, 28, a painter from Gorakhpur district, said they had no place to wait for the government to put them on a train. “The landlord made us vacate the house for non-payment of rent. The ₹6,000 advance we had paid was made good for rent of two months we were unable to pay. We are anyway on the streets, so better we start walking home,” he said.Bhimashankar Guled, DCP (Northeast), said they had been patrolling National Highway 44 on Friday and detained over 1,500 persons who had begun their walk home the same day. “We sent back those who had accommodation to stay in the city, telling them to wait for their turn to get on a train. We also arranged two shelters where there are around 150 labourers who did not have houses to go back to,” he said. Migrant labourers are taking the highway in the zone to leave the city. Dr. Guled said there was a special train to Uttar Pradesh on Saturday only for people in the zone.Till HyderabadMeanwhile, several of the labourers The Hindu had caught up with on Thursday as they trekked along the highway had reached Hyderabad by Friday evening. Rajesh Paswan, 31, a painter, said most of them walked till the Andhra Pradesh border where the police stopped them. “They gave us dinner and asked us to return to Bengaluru. But we refused. Eventually, they put us in a truck to Hyderabad. We are trying to find some transport from here. If not, we will resume our walk on Saturday,” he said.Mohammed Naushad, 28, who sold ready-made garments on the pavements of Majestic, said Andhra Pradesh police sent them back towards Bengaluru. However, as they were walking back, a truck driver offered them a ride. “We are a group of eight. We will get dropped till Nagpur in the truck as it is headed there,” he said."

They have been directed to follow all the norms announced by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Garment units in the State have been hiring a large number of workers, a majority of them women. The State government has already allowed other kinds of industries to operate, both in rural and urban areas. Meanwhile, hundreds of garment workers employed by a private garment factory in Peenya have been staging protests since Friday over the non-payment of salary for nearly 40 days. They have also alleged a lack of communication from the owners on when the factory will reopen. “We have not been paid for the month of April and there has been absolutely no response either from the management of the factory or from the Labour Department even after repeated requests,” said Ravi, a garment worker. He added that most of the protesters, including pregnant women, were getting to the protest venue on foot. Another worker said that his friends who worked in other factories had been paid 40-50% of the salary. “We understand the situation and we were expecting at least half of our wages. Even when we are paid in full, we lead a hand-to-mouth existence. Now our situation is worsening by the day as we haven’t been paid for over a month,” he said.R.

From discounts to virtual tours of their stores, and allowing customers to make purchases via video calls — owners are adjusting to a new reality. Suhail Yusuf, Secretary of Brigade Road Shops and Establishments Association, said many stores were offering rebates of up to 50%. “Our members are calling their customers and informing them that they are open. But despite that there are almost no walk-ins,” he said. Mr. Yusuf said shops were being advised to ensure that not more than a third of their staff report to work. Only a limited number of people are allowed inside the stores at a given time. Customers will be allowed in only after they undergo thermal screening and they sanitise their hands. Air conditioners will be switched off. Even stores that don’t usually provide home delivery services were upping their game. “I visited the website of a clothing brand which was offering a 50% discount. I thought it is the best time to buy and I have placed my order on the phone,” said Shefali K., a software professional. Anand, store manager, Looking Good Furniture, Basaveshwara Nagar, said they were allowing customers a virtual shopping experience. “Customers can video call us and select our products. We have offers on every product,” he said, adding that the store is sanitised three times a day. “We also sanitise all the products before delivery and send a video clip to customers.” However, Mr. Anand too said, while there were enquiries, sales have remained low. Another reason for the dip in sales volume is the financial toll the pandemic has taken. With so much uncertainty, people are unwilling to spend money on non-essential items. “My salary was cut by 30% and I don’t want to splurge on anything. So, though I am being bombarded with calls and messages from several stores, I am ignoring them,” said Krishna N., a private company employee."

Using masks has been made mandatory in all public places to fight COVID-19 pandemic. As they are forced to segregate waste and pick these masks, waste-pickers are exposed to the risk of contracting the infection. “Every day, we are getting thousands of masks, used tissue paper, and gloves in the dry waste we are collecting from households. We are forced to segregate these potentially hazardous material putting us at risk of COVID-19,” said Mansoor, a waste picker who runs the DWCC at Pattabhiramnagar, ward number 168.Hasiru Dala, which works with waste pickers, has been distributing masks and gloves to be used during work. “We have been creating awareness among waste-pickers to use gloves for many years now, but to little success. COVID-19 has brought about a behavioural change in them, which we hope stays post the crisis as well,” said Nalini Sekhar of Hasiru Dala. Many centres closedHowever, despite using masks and gloves during work, concerns of contracting COVID-19 while handling such waste remain. “Many waste pickers have shut down the DWCCs as they were fearing contracting the infection. While lack of transport facilities during the lockdown was the trigger, dry waste being inundated by masks is also one of the reasons why they are hesitant to reopen,” said A. Krishna, a waste picker managing a DWCC at Domlur, ward number 112.

Though three-way segregation — dry, wet, and sanitary — is the norm, as per the Solid Waste Management Rules, 2016, this is not being implemented owing to lack of secondary collection.The civic body has floated tenders for sanitary waste to be picked up separately and incinerated, like biomedical waste. The tender, senior officials of the BBMP said, was in the final stages of being finalised. The city generates around 36 tonnes of sanitary waste a day. “In another two weeks, each zone will have a dedicated biomedical waste collector, who will be pressed into action to collect these masks and other such material from dry waste collection centres (DWCCs) to be disposed of in a scientific manner,” said BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) D. Randeep.The technical and financial approval of the tender is under progress. Sanitary waste will be picked up from the secondary collection points in each ward and transported to the incinerators. “As per the norms of the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB), only authorised biomedical waste handlers with incineration facilities can participate in the tender,” he said.Meanwhile, it is status quo for the new garbage tenders. SWM officials, who spoke to The Hindu on condition of anonymity, said the tenders that were for collection of only wet waste were almost finalised. However, Mayor M. Goutham Kumar had criticised the model and claimed that it would result in a garbage crisis. He said the BBMP should go in for a model where in a single vehicle with separate compartments to collect wet, dry, and sanitary waste every day. The Mayor and Commissioner B.H.

Nagar wait for fresh vegetables from Anekal farmers at their doorsteps. In some other areas in the city, people queue up to buy premium quality grapes from Chickballapur.The COVID-19 crisis might have hit the farmers hard, but the silver lining is that several enterprising farmers have begun to look beyond conventional markets by connecting directly with consumers.Several farmers, who hitherto did not focus much on marketing their produce, have now started exploring direct marketing concepts by avoiding middlemen. While this method has helped sustain them during the lockdown, experts feel that this is likely to gain further momentum in the post-lockdown scenario too.The trend suggests that farmers who came as a group or backed by institutional support, in particular, managed a greater degree of success. This has put the limelight on Farmers’ Producers’ Organisations (FPO), which are organised groups of about 1,000 farmers each.Chaitra, CEO of the Rajghatta FPO, says that her organisation, comprising mostly vegetable and fruit farmers, has managed to establish links with several apartments in Marathahalli. “We tried to explore markets directly and sent a small load of vegetables, worth around ₹20,000, to some of the apartments. The response was very good and the residents praised the freshness and quality of produce and the reasonable price. Encouraged by this, we sent two vehicles of vegetables and fruits worth around ₹60,000 the next day around 2 p.m. Such was the response that residents were buying them till 2 a.m.,” she says.Now, her FPO has fine-tuned its marketing strategy based on customers’ feedback and sends the produce only during weekends. “We manage to sell two to three tonnes of produce just during weekends,” she points out. She is planning to strengthen their marketing strategy further by buying new vehicles for vegetable sales as soon as the pandemic recedes.Siddaraju, CEO of Anekal Horticultural Farmers’ Producers Company Ltd., says his organisation, comprising growers of a variety of vegetables including English cucumber, is now selling its produce directly to consumers on streets of various localities in J.P. Nagar. “We focus on localities as there are no restrictions,” he says. His organisation too is planning to further build on their direct marketing concept post lockdown.Ravi Sajjannavar, director of Hungund HFPCL, has set up a procurement centre in Bengaluru for fresh produce.“We have started reaching out to other farmers beyond our locality or group. In fact, I have reached out to farmers in distress based on media reports and social media posts,” says Mr. Ravi, whose organisation is selling farmers’ produce directly to various big retail units in Bengaluru. “Till last week, we procured 50 to 80 tonnes of onion, 20 to 35 tonnes of ginger, 20 tonnes of grapes, and five tonnes of mixed vegetables among others and managed to sell them without the intervention of middlemen,” he added."

There was a long line of vehicles at the State’s border with Tamil Nadu, as many were not prepared to go for a 14-day institutional quarantine and were confused whether to go back, or go into quarantine.While the check-posts at Karnataka-Maharashtra border also implemented the norm, there was no pile-up of vehicles at the border there. Many were seen requesting officials for option to be in home quarantine. While asymptomatic people from other States are given that option, those from the five States categorised as high risk by the Ministry of Home Affairs — Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan, and Delhi — have to go into institutional quarantine, even if asymptomatic.The decision to implement the May 7 guidelines was taken at a meeting of senior Ministers, chaired by Chief Minister B.S.

Her parents reached Chennai from Bengaluru city on Sunday morning to fetch her back home. However, as they were returning to the city the same evening, the Karnataka police refused to let them in unless they agreed for institutional quarantine. “We have valid travel passes issued by both Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.

While some claimed they received a text message after they boarded the train at Delhi, others said they learned about it only after reaching Bengaluru.Confusion and anger played out at KSR (Bengaluru) City Railway Station as passengers started protesting when officials insisted that they undergo institutional quarantine. Many of them refused, pointing out that they did not have the financial resources to afford a hotel room for 14 days. BBMP authorities, however, said they had made arrangements for free quarantine facilities for those who could not afford to pay hotel rates.Not preparedLakshmi Narayanan, who travelled form Jhansi, said, “I am a law-abiding citizen, but they should have informed us in advance so we could have prepared better financially or regarding clothes or medicines. To be prepared for it mentally is also a challenge.”Shreyansh, a resident of Bengaluru who came with his mother from Delhi, said, “I had booked the tickets on May 11 and I did not receive any message at the time. On May 12, when I boarded the train with my mother, I received a message from the Karnataka government that institutional quarantine is a must. After reaching Bengaluru, we pleaded with officials to allow us to undergo home quarantine.”Mr. Shreyansh said they spent hours at the station before he and his mother agreed to institutional quarantine. “I was moved to a facility at Gandhinagar where I have to pay somewhere between ₹1,600 and ₹2,200 per day. We are already in financial distress owing to the lockdown,” he added.Ankit Jain, who travelled from Secunderabad, said he got to know about the mandatory quarantine only after the train reached KSR station. He added that he would not have come to the city had he known about the rules. Civic officials, however, pointed out that in the early days of the pandemic, when COVID-19 was not so widespread, many had violated home quarantine.According to officials, some passengers had also misread the message, which said that asymptotic passengers would be quarantined while those with symptoms of COVID-19 would be hospitalised. “Many didn’t realise that they fell in the asymptomatic category and thought that they would be allowed to go home,” said an official.A South Western Railway (SWR) official said, “On the IRTC website prior to booking the ticket, the passengers were informed that they have to adhere to health protocols of the visiting State. We had also provided hyperlink of State-wise advisory on arrival. They should have read it prior to booking tickets.”As the chaos and arguments continued for hours, senior officials tried to pacify angry passengers. Many passengers spent the entire day at the station trying to find a solution. “I was there at the station from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. Later, officials convinced us to go to quarantine by saying that if two tests come negative, we will be asked to go home. When I reached the hotel, health officials here told us that there is no such option and that 14 days quarantine is mandatory. I do not know whom to trust. I have to pay ₹2,200 for the accommodation and food per day,” said Manoj Singh, who boarded at Delhi. No social distancePassengers alleged that more than 300 people were asked to sit in the waiting room and that maintaining social distance also was difficult. Some also said that they were provided food at 4 p.m.BBMP Commissioner B.H. Anil Kumar said, “We are following the directions of the State government. We had to convince many people and most of them agreed and went to quarantine. It is unfortunate that some protested and argued with our officials claiming that they were not informed. It is in the benefit of the their families and society as a whole that they should be under institutional quarantine.”"

This seems to stem from the fact that the information did not reach those who were on the waiting list and were accommodated on the train in the last minute.Primary and Secondary Education Minister S. Suresh Kumar said that waitlisted passengers had been accommodated after some cancelled their tickets on learning about the quarantine rule.“The mandatory institutional quarantine announcement was made at the station at Delhi and messages had also been sent to all the passengers whose tickets were confirmed.

734,Karnataka,"May 14, 2020 23:31 IST",Karnataka,Bengaluru,Karnataka authorities caught between desperate migrant workers and bureaucratic red tape,"The State government appears to be caught between a huge number of desperate migrant workers wishing to get back to their families and their home States that are wary of accepting them.For instance, while thousands of distressed workers are waiting for their turn to board trains, Bihar has asked the State to limit the number of train to one per day. Odisha and West Bengal are insisting on granular details, which would entail time-consuming bureaucratic procedures, before approving the train to leave.The authorities are now working on ways to placate the migrant workers from leaving the State in distress or persuade them to patiently wait for their turn to get into the train, sources said.Meeting with unionsIn one such exercise on Thursday, Revenue Secretary N. Manjunath Prasad and Police Commissioner Bhaskar Rao, who met the labour union representatives to understand the ground realities, were told that the labourers had become “restive, agitated, and troubled” because of not getting wages for the past two months and are desperate to return home. On Tuesday, the High Court of Karnataka also directed the State government to convene a meeting of all stakeholders to explore the possibility of generating money to fund the travel of those labourers who cannot afford to pay for their travel.So far, 43 Shramik Special trains have been operated from the State, which have carried more than 56,000 migrants back home. The highest number of trains — 13 — has left for Uttar Pradesh, followed by Bihar at 11, Jharkhand - 5, Rajasthan - 4, West Bengal - 3, and Madhya Pradesh - 2. One each train has been run to Odisha, Tripura, Himachal Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Uttarakhand.Bihar, which is grappling with migrants returning home in big numbers, has allowed one train from Karnataka to be operated daily as it is receiving 53 Shramik Specials every day. However, despite Bengaluru having a large number of migrant workers from Odisha and West Bengal, the two States have been stringent in receiving the migrants back. “The two States have asked for segregation and accommodation of workers in each coach based on the districts. Then the list of passengers have to be sent to them for approval. This is turning out to be a huge inconvenience for authorities here to do this,” sources said.Registered so farCurrently, as many as 2.5 lakh migrants workers wishing to return to their villages have registered themselves on Seva Sindhu app. The State government’s estimate is that if 12 trains are operated from across the State daily, and if all States provide quick approval for the trains to leave, it may take more than a fortnight to clear the rush. However, currently between two and six trains are running from the State."

The 179 passengers include 40 pregnant women and none of them tested positive in the first test. ‘Protocol followed’Members of the Dubai Anivasi Kannadigaru claimed that all required protocols were followed before the ‘fit to travel’ stamping was issued.“All those who registered to travel from Dubai to India were screened meticulously and tested using rapid testing strips. Only those who got a ‘fit to travel’ stamping were allowed to board the flight,” Naveed Magundi, president of Dubai Anivasi Kannadigaru and a team member of Kannadigas Helpline there, told The Hindu from Dubai.Stating that the results have shown 99% accuracy among those who went to Kerala from Dubai, he said, “We do not know what went wrong and if the 21 who tested positive in Karnataka contracted the infection at the airport or during transit.” Kannadigas Helpline is a team of NRIs who are coordinating to arrange for the travel of those who want to return to India from Dubai.“We are now in talks with Indian consulate, Mangaluru district administration, and other authorities to handle the situation better. We have also suggested to the Indian consulate that travellers should be tested using the RT-PCR technique before they are allowed to travel,” he said.Rapid test V. Ravi, senior professor and head of Neuro Virology at NIMHANS, who is part of the COVID-19 expert committee that is tasked with analysing how the disease infects people, said rapid tests are not meant for diagnosis of COVID-19 infection. “They are meant for surveillance purposes only. While a positive test through rapid testing indicates exposure to the virus 14 days prior to the date of testing, a negative test does not rule out COVID-19 infection,” he said.“That is why the government has come up with guidelines that all those landing from other countries have to be mandatorily tested through RT-PCR technique and quarantined,” he added.Passenger from U.S. symptomaticA repatriation flight of Air India from San Francisco, U.S., landed at Kempegowda International Airport (KIA) on Friday morning. The flight had a scheduled stopover at Delhi airport before reaching Bengaluru. A total of 107 stranded people were on it.Bengaluru Rural Deputy Commissioner P.N. Ravindra told The Hindu that during the mandatory screening at the airport, one passenger was found symptomatic and he was sent to Rajiv Gandhi Institute of Chest Diseases for further tests and treatment.

737,Karnataka,"May 15, 2020 23:54 IST",Bengaluru,Bengaluru,Lockdown effect: No space for dry waste,"The lockdown has had an unintentional effect on the city’s dry waste collection centres (DWCCs). Most of the centres are inundated with non-recyclable items such as low-value plastic as the cement factories where these items are usually transported, have been shut since the start of the lockdown. With no clarity on whether the cement factories will reopen next week when lockdown restrictions are expected to be lifted, managers of various DWCCs that are running out of storage space have urged the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) to identify locations where non-recyclable waste can be aggregated.Rajesh Babu, co-founder, Swachha Eco Solutions, told The Hindu that there was at least 60 tonnes of dry waste, including recyclables, at each of the 11 DWCCs it manages. Another 150 tonnes of aggregated waste is lying at its processing centre. “It is hazardous to keep it stocked as it is all flammable. This is giving us sleepless nights,” he said.The representative of another organisation that manages over 50 DWCCs, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said dry waste has been piling up for the last three months. “Already most DWCCs struggle with space constraints. We have now started refusing to accept dry waste from the pourakarmikas,” said the representative.Waste management expert N.S. Ramakanth said that with many DWCCs refusing to take in more waste and the recycling industry yet to be revived, materials like high value plastic and other recyclables are reaching landfills as mixed waste.Admitting that this is cause for concern, BBMP’s Special Commissioner (Solid Waste Management) D. Randeep said that the civic body has DWCCs to aggregate waste at the waste processing units at Doddabidarakallu, Kannahalli and Subbarayanapalya. Civic officials in-charge of the processing plants said that there was around 1,000 tonnes of RDF stocked in the three plants.“Not all dry waste is ending up at the landfill. We are exploring the option of tying up with an individual, who has offered to transport it to cement factories for free,” said Mr. Randeep.BBMP trying to offload by-products of compost The BBMP’s trying to offload nearly 70,000 tonnes of coarse compost at its eight waste processing units by giving it free of cost to farmers, based on the recommendation of the Technical Guidance Committee (TGC).TGC member Ganesh Murthy told The Hindu that compost is usually sieved using mesh of different sizes. There are different grades of material at the end of the process. The fine compost is sold by the BBMP at a subsidised rate of ₹1,100 a tonne, which includes cost of transport up to 100 km from the plants.“The coarse material also possesses the same organic material as fine compost, except that it may contain some small plastic pieces. It requires another two months to get fully composted,” he said, following which it can be sieved again to remove the plastic bits.However, farmers will have to arrange for vehicles to transport the coarse organic material to their fields."

Classes in shifts, no extra curricular activities or assemblies in playgrounds will be the new normal. A group of experts including officials of the Department of Public Instruction and teachers have been holding brainstorming sessions on formulating new standard operating protocol for schools. The committee submitted a draft of guidelines to the DPI on Friday. According to some of the guidelines, schools will have to conduct classes while ensuring that students maintain a physical distance from each other. The Department of Public Instruction has also suggested that schools in the State conduct classes in two shifts for the 2020-21 academic year. The first shift of classes will begin from 7.50 a.m. and end at 12.20 p.m., and the second shift will be from 12.10 p.m. to 5 p.m.The department has also suggested that schools conduct only 36 classes per week by cutting down extra curricular classes such as music, art and physical education. Some of the other draft guidelines include having only three students seated on each desk. Besides this, schools have been told that they can take over community centres or government buildings in case they are short of space. Students will also be instructed to maintain social distancing while commuting. Wearing masks and washing hands regularly will be mandatory.The department has also decided to chalk out an elaborate plan to be followed during lunch breaks. The department has suggested that the distribution of milk and midday meals also can be done in batches. S.R. Umashankar, principal secretary of the department, said that suggestions will be finalised after a meeting with the State government. “The dates for reopening schools have yet to be finalised. We are waiting for guidelines from the Ministry of Human Resource Development as well,” he said."

They have said that they are in distress and left high and dry by the authorities.Prasanna Srujan Reddy Chinta, who has been stranded in Dhaka since March 24, said there are around 75 to 80 people from the State stuck in the capital of Bangladesh.“I had come for business purpose and have been stuck here for over 50 days. People are in distress and no one is addressing our grievances. We are spending a huge amount of money for accommodation and food. After the lockdown was imposed, I tried to reach India through land route. However, authorities denied permission and asked me to go back. Our family members are very concerned,” Mr. Chinta said. Stranded people from the State maintain that the High Commission of India had promised to accommodate them on a flight that left to Chennai on May 14. However, the plan was dropped without giving any valid reason. “Had authorities made a coordinated effort, we could have reached Bengaluru at least by road form Chennai; unfortunately that did not happen,” said another stranded person from the State who did not wished to be named.‘No flight to Bengaluru’ Srinivas V., who is also stranded, said, “Flights under Vande Bharat Mission were operated from Dhaka to Jammu and Kashmir, Delhi, Chennai, and other places. But no fights were planned to Bengaluru. Owing to COVID-19, I have lost my job and living here has become very difficult without any income source. The State government should a take up the issue with the Central authorities.”Those stranded say they have tried all types of media, including social media, to reach out to the governments and heads of various institutions, but are yet to receive a positive response from them."
740,Karnataka,"May 15, 2020 23:29 IST",Karnataka,Bengaluru,Authorities pick up migrants walking home to put them on trains,"Bipin Kumar, 24, is one of the 75 labourers who left their jobs in Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu last week to begin the long trek to their home towns in Uttar Pradesh. With at least six children, all aged under 10, the labourers took turns to carry them as they walked in the heat.But when they approached the Tamil Nadu–Karnataka border three days ago, the Karnataka police detained them and housed them at the Bangalore International Exhibition Centre (BIEC), with the aim of ensuring that they complete the rest of their journey by train. The BIEC has been turned into a temporary shelter for migrants walking to States in north India. And it is houseful.The centre presently has nearly a thousand such migrant labourers who were detained at the Karnataka–Tamil Nadu border as well those found walking along National Highway 44 towards Hyderabad. Following reports of migrant labourers in Bengaluru embarking on foot to north India, Chief Minister B.S. Yediyurappa is learnt to have directed officers to ensure that all those walking home are put on trains. This has kicked off a special drive by the police who are rounding up all migrants, including those from other States. No milk for childrenMr. Kumar who works in a garment factory said that he and the others in his group did not have a choice but to leave. “The factory had provided us accommodation and food till May 4. However, with the extension of the lockdown for the third time, the factory owners stopped giving us rations and other facilities,” said Bipin Kumar. Carrying his one-and-a-half-year-old son Abhishek, Mr. Kuamr was desperately searching for milk, which is currently not available. Food and other facilities have been provided, but not milk. There are at least 30 children at the BIEC, including eight-month-old Arti from Vikarabad district of Telangana. Sarfaraz Khan, Joint Commissioner, BBMP, who is in charge of facilities at the centre, said they have taken note of the issue and milk would be supplied from Saturday. Waiting to leavePeople housed at the BIEC are impatient to go home. Umesh Kumar, 28, who worked as a mason in Mysuru and began walking to his home in Jharkhand four days ago before he was brought to the centre by the police, said, “I have been at the BIEC for two days now and all promises of a train have proved false. We want to desperately get home. If they cannot arrange trains, let them leave us from here, we will walk home.” His sentiment is echoed by hundreds of stranded migrants.Last week, the police had similarly detained nearly 300 people walking along NH 44 and housed them in two marriage halls at Kodigehalli. Several of them have now been shifted to the BIEC. “I was detained by the police on May 7 and I am still at the BIEC waiting for a train to get back home. Many of my friends who escaped were able to hitch rides on trucks and have already reached home,” said Dileep Kumar Sahni, 28, from Uttar Pradesh, who worked as a carpenter in Bengaluru. A senior official said, “The hands of the Karnataka government are tied, as the home States of migrant labourers are rationing out permissions for trains to stagger the influx into their States. But it is increasingly becoming tough to manage them for long.” A help desk at the BIEC is helping the migrant labourers register on Seva Sindhu, an online portal for travel out of the State. “We are prioritising those at the BIEC to be sent home and we will look after them till they board trains,” said Ravi B. Channannavar, Superintendent of Police, Bengaluru Rural district. Many migrant labourers are still choosing to walk home, and were spotted on NH 44, on Friday too, though their numbers have come down from the previous weeks. Most of them continue to be detained and housed in shelters such as the BIEC."

744,Karnataka,"May 16, 2020 21:46 IST",Karnataka,Bengaluru,Farm labourers were the worst-hit group in rural Karnataka in April,"“I allowed my pumpkin crop to rot on three acres of land as harvesting and transportation were not possible during the lockdown,” a farmer from Davangere district lamented.His was one of the 71% of households adversely affected in rural Karnataka during the COVID-19 lockdown on account of loss of employment, business, and inability to harvest or sell agricultural produce. This was revealed in a telephonic study conducted in Belagavi, Chamarajanagar, Dakshina Kannada, Davangere, and Kalaburagi districts during April-May 2020 by the Centre for Decentralisation and Development, Institute of Social and Economic Change, Bengaluru.COVID-19 affected a large proportion of households in Belagavi in particular. Kalaburagi was affected to a lesser degree because farmers did not have any standing crop and dependence on farm wage work was in any case low during the agriculturally slack season. None of the households reported COVID-19-related symptoms.Of those affected, 92% (two persons per household on an average) reported income loss during April. Income loss was measured for one month in case of workers and micro-enterprises, while it was for the entire crop season for cultivators. The extent of loss was low among labourers and high among cultivators as the latter often lost their entire crop.Wage labourersThe largest affected category was agricultural wage labourers (51%), who reported an average income loss of ₹6,700 in April. The next category was non-agricultural workers involved in construction and rolling of beedis. Comprising 19% of the workers, they reported an average income loss of ₹12,586 in April.Salaried employees in the informal sector — the third largest category making up 11% — were asked to stay at home to maintain social distancing. Though the government called for compassion in paying full salaries to informal workers, 10% of the employees, engaged in transport (truck and JCB drivers), factories, companies and hotels, were not paid the April salary ranging from ₹4,000 to ₹22,000.The next significant category was cultivators, accounting for 9% of the affected. They incurred income loss because of two reasons. For one, they were unable to harvest owing to non-availability of labour and reported an average income loss of ₹1.01 lakh in the crop season. For instance, a farmer from Chamarajanagar district allowed vegetables worth ₹80,000 to rot in the field. Secondly, many could not sell harvested or standing crops because of transport disruption, high transportation costs, non-availability of market, and sharp decline in prices. Such farmers reported an average income loss of ₹59,300. For instance, a farmer from Davangere district could not transport harvested brinjal worth ₹1 lakh because of non-availability of trucks. Another farmer from Belagavi district allowed his chillies to rot as prices plummeted.Micro-enterprisesThe last category was owners of micro-enterprises such as photo shops, hotels, ice cream vending shops, and mechanic shops. Consisting of 9% of the worker force, they reported an average income loss of ₹24,000 in April as they were forced to shut shop. A tent house owner from Davangere district closed his shop as public meetings and weddings were banned. He thereby incurred a loss of ₹40,000.

Sixty-four positive cases have been reported in 10 days. The administration is grappling with poor medical staff and a slow rate of testing.It started with the sudden death of Ghulam Nabi Mir, 54, on April 7. With no travel history or contact with a positive case, Mir, a fruit dealer, died within a day of his admission to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital in Srinagar.“Mir had no travel or contact history. However, all 11 members of his family have tested positive,” Hajin Block Medical Officer Ajaz Ahmad told The Hindu. Thirty-one people, whose had contact with Mir, have tested positive so far.Dr. Ahmad described the situation at Gund Jahangir, which has 604 households and 3,650 residents, as “a case of cluster spread”. “We are trying our best to break the chain. We continue to collect the samples of the contacts,” he said. Gund Jahangir, 16 km away from the district headquarters, has a large farming community, with 50% of it living below the poverty line “We can earn only when we tend our fields. We have daughters to marry off and children to send to school. I fail to understand why even healthy men are being taken away to quarantine centres,” said Nazir Laway, a farmer. According to the official figures, 31 locals have been kept in hospital quarantine, 150 in administrative quarantine and around 400 in home quarantine. They account for almost 16% of the total population.Gund Jahangir has the highest number of cases in any tehsil of the Union Territory, which has reported 328 positive cases. The emerging pattern is adding to the administration’s worries. “Around 90% cases that tested positive were asymptomatic. We are dealing with a fluid situation, wherein everyone is a suspect. It has spread fast in the community,” Syed Shahnawaz Bukhari, an officer on special duty in Bandipora, said. The pace of testing is so slow that just 180 samples have been collected from Gund Jahangir. “We are awaiting the results of 60-70 samples sent from Hajin,” said Dr. Ajaz. The area is manned by five teams, headed by five doctors, out of 10 doctors assigned to Hajin. “Testing the vulnerable old population should be our priority,” said Mr. Bukhari. Dr. Ahmad admitted that the administration was “yet to start random testing” despite the cluster cases. This is the result of the poor testing capacity in Kashmir.

So far, the impact of the virus has been mild on animals, but we cannot take a chance,” he added.Impacting gucchi businessThe tightened lockdown, however, is likely to impact collection of rare morels.“Kashmir gucchi, wild mushrooms, are delicious mushrooms,” said a local farmer. “It possesses antioxidant property. It’s proven that it helps in preventing diseases like hypertension, hyperglycemia, and cancer,” the farmer added.Gucchi (Morchella), is considered an exotic species of the mushroom family. It grows in forests located above 2,000 meters from sea level. “Those who collect gucchis trek hundreds of miles through forests to identify them. Only locals could identify the gucchi in a forest,” said the farmer.The mushrooms sell for ₹4,000 per kilogram. “It will impact our income this year,” said another farmer. Kashmir produces more than ₹5 lakh worth of gucchi annually."

Sixty-four positive cases have been reported in 10 days. The administration is grappling with poor medical staff and a slow rate of testing.It started with the sudden death of Ghulam Nabi Mir, 54, on April 7. With no travel history or contact with a positive case, Mir, a fruit dealer, died within a day of his admission to Shri Maharaja Hari Singh Hospital in Srinagar.“Mir had no travel or contact history. However, all 11 members of his family have tested positive,” Hajin Block Medical Officer Ajaz Ahmad told The Hindu. Thirty-one people, whose had contact with Mir, have tested positive so far.Dr. Ahmad described the situation at Gund Jahangir, which has 604 households and 3,650 residents, as “a case of cluster spread”. “We are trying our best to break the chain. We continue to collect the samples of the contacts,” he said. Gund Jahangir, 16 km away from the district headquarters, has a large farming community, with 50% of it living below the poverty line “We can earn only when we tend our fields. We have daughters to marry off and children to send to school. I fail to understand why even healthy men are being taken away to quarantine centres,” said Nazir Laway, a farmer. According to the official figures, 31 locals have been kept in hospital quarantine, 150 in administrative quarantine and around 400 in home quarantine. They account for almost 16% of the total population.Gund Jahangir has the highest number of cases in any tehsil of the Union Territory, which has reported 328 positive cases. The emerging pattern is adding to the administration’s worries. “Around 90% cases that tested positive were asymptomatic. We are dealing with a fluid situation, wherein everyone is a suspect. It has spread fast in the community,” Syed Shahnawaz Bukhari, an officer on special duty in Bandipora, said. The pace of testing is so slow that just 180 samples have been collected from Gund Jahangir. “We are awaiting the results of 60-70 samples sent from Hajin,” said Dr. Ajaz. The area is manned by five teams, headed by five doctors, out of 10 doctors assigned to Hajin. “Testing the vulnerable old population should be our priority,” said Mr. Bukhari. Dr. Ahmad admitted that the administration was “yet to start random testing” despite the cluster cases. This is the result of the poor testing capacity in Kashmir. Of 58,076 people in quarantine, the government had sent 5,366 samples for testing till April 16.

Missing even one session could cost me my life,” said Aqueel Ahmad, undergoing the procedure for 10 years. “In such a condition where will I go now?

Furthermore, 10,550 (1.84% of the survivors) had been given ex gratia compensation as cancer patients.

In addition, three persons from the city have succumbed to COVID-19. Besides, eight cases in Jabalpur, six in Ujjain, four in Bhopal, and two each in Shivpuri and Gwalior have been registered.According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), community transmission is evidenced by the inability to relate confirmed cases through chains of transmission for a large number of cases, or by increasing positive tests through sentinel samples.Also read: A look into key aspects of virus pandemic“Coincidently almost all positive cases, including first ones, have come from congested areas, so probably they have done a lot of community transmission,” said Dr. Sakalle. Though pockets have been identified, that doesn’t spell a possible wiping out of the virus locally. “If we are able to contain it in certain pockets and cover all contacts, then maybe we can make it controlled. We have no way to control their [overall] number,” he added.Also read: Coronavirus | No community transmission yet, says Health MinistryAggressive testing in relation to other cities like Bhopal and Jabalpur has yielded more numbers too. Until March 30, the college had tested 261 samples since March 21. “Most cases in the first lot for Indore were those admitted to government and private hospital ICUs whose samples we took to test for acute severe respiratory illnesses when the testing for COVID-19 was restricted to only those with travel history abroad. When the ICMR revised the guidelines, we ran their samples for COVID-19 too, and many tested positive,” explained Dr. Sakalle.Subsequently, those who had come into contact with these persons tested positive too. “Those who’re dying, are either elderly or have some comorbidities of diabetes or hypertension,” he said.The city’s cosmopolitan culture, Indore being a transit corridor, the recent political instability in the State and residents not taking the lockdown seriously have all aggravated the outbreak of the illness in Indore, opines Anand Rai, part of the Indore COVID-19 response team.“There are at least 80-90 flights to Indore per day. It’s the economic hub of Madhya Pradesh unlike Bhopal, and boasts a mix of cultures,” Dr. Rai explained.The district administration has pulled out all stops, rolling out an odd-even road rationing scheme from March 28 and drawing containment areas within a 3 km radius around the houses of patients. where traffic is prohibited and all residents quarantined. In a spiralling trend, four persons tested positive on Saturday, while seven did on Sunday .“Still, those staying in clusters, due to low literacy levels refuse to abide by the lockdown as the illness is an invisible enemy,” said Dr. Rai. “There will be 300-400 positive cases in the coming days,” he predicted.Moreover, Madhya Pradesh was currently combating the disease ‘half-heartedly’ in the absence of a Health or Home Minister in the fledgling BJP government, he asserted, adding that the recent transfers of district Collectors of Indore, Bhopal and Jabalpur had ruffled the administrative machinery.In addition, the city buttressed a culture of cohesion and commingling which might re,sult in pushing up the numbers, said Ajay Sodani, Professor at an Indore-based college, who has been following the spurt closely. “People think like a community here. Sadly on the janta curfew day, scores of people came out on the streets together to clang thalis and beat drums.”Furthermore, he said, government officials at times were sending out a wrong message. “They are encouraging people to cover faces with cloth masks. However, it has to be a triple-layer surgical or an N95 mask. These disappeared from the market long ago. The WHO has said that those made of cotton should not be worn in any condition.”"

While the other new cases are symptomatic, the three men showed no symptoms of the disease. Just two women from Indore tested positive, while the remaining ten are men. The women are aged 80 years and 53 years, while the men’s ages range from 38 years to 54 years.

While his wife developed a cough and cold, he developed headache and fever. They have been admitted to a hospital.”Until 9 p.m. on Wednesday, of the 32 patients in Indore, the condition of 24 had improved, while eight remained in a critical condition, according to the college.‘Patients recovering’ Whereas Indore Collector Manish Singh on Wednesday afternoon said 20 patients had already recovered, he added, “But we will keep them at the hospital for a while. Once they test negative twice, we will discharge them. Patients are recovering from this disease.”Doctors earlier told The Hindu that congested areas in the city were a hotspot. “Areas like Ranipura and Daulatganj are a challenge for us and we are having a special focus on Khajrana and Chandan Nagar. In Azad Nagar, where one person had tested positive, we confined 70 persons in quarantine. We are cordoning these areas using force,” said Mr. Singh. Besides Indore, Jabalpur has registered eight cases, Ujjain six, Bhopal eight, Shivpuri, Gwalior and Morena two each, and Khargone one. Two residents of Ujjain and one of Khargone have died. To enforce the lockdown strictly and monitor possible contacts, the State government has declared 17 containment zones around houses of the patients in Indore, six in Jabalpur and two each in Bhopal, Gwalior,Shivpuri and Ujjain."

She tested positive along with an Additional Director in the Directorate of Health Services tasked with implementing strategies to combat the outbreak in the State, according to Sudhir Dehariya, Bhopal Chief Medical and Health Officer. The results came two days after the IAS officer tasked for procuring drugs and equipment for public healthcare institutions in the State had tested positive. The 2011-batch officer, the MD of the Madhya Pradesh Public Health Services Corporation Limited and CEO of the State Ayushman Bharat Yojana, had contracted the illness without having travel or contact history, said an official at the Directorate, requesting anonymity. As more and more bureaucrats test positive for the virus in the State, others have begun staying in isolation in their homes. As a result, the government has prepared a proposed second line of 14 IAS officers to take charge of various departments. Meanwhile, district Collector Tarun Kumar Pithode declared the houses of those who tested positive on Friday as “epicentres”, and the area within a kilometre of their radius as “containment area”. All those residing within the area will be screened. Meanwhile, one of the largest wholesale traders of potatoes and onions in Bhopal’s Karond mandi tested positive too.

814,Madhya Pradesh,"April 08, 2020 04:07 IST",National,Bhopal,"COVID-19| Fatality rate in Indore surpasses that of New Delhi, Mumbai","With deaths owing to the COVID-19 spiralling in Indore, the case fatality rate in the cleanest city touched 8.6% on Tuesday, arguably the highest for any city in the country, even ahead of the rates in Mumbai and New Delhi which had recorded more than three times the number of cases than Indore. Experts suggest the deaths of 15 patients in Indore until April 7 can be attributed to delayed diagnosis, late admission to hospitals in an unfair general condition, comorbidities, old age, acute respiratory distress syndrome and a high viral load. So far, Indore, the largest and the most populous city of Madhya Pradesh, has recorded 173 cases. Between March 22, when Indore recorded its first COVID-19 case, and April 7, Mumbai recorded 618 cases and 39 deaths and New Delhi 524 and eight deaths. The case fatality rate, a measure of disease severity which records the proportion of those who die from a disease among all those diagnosed with it over a certain period of time, for Mumbai stands at 6.3%, and for New Delhi 1.5%. A higher rate reflects a poor outcome. A typical COVID-19 patient would have a contact and travel history, be diagnosed, admitted after which he/she may die or survive. But none of the cases in Indore had an international travel history, explained Salil Bhargava, Head of the Department, Respiratory Medicine, Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore. “Most of the patients who died had bilateral pneumonia, which caused acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) eventually causing death,” said Dr. Bhargava. “Their presentation at the hospital has been late, which is one issue, and they are being presented in bad shape and having severe respiratory distress. Once the ARDS settles in, it’s almost impossible to save the patient.” Furthermore, almost all the deceased had comorbidities (suffered from another illness that made them vulnerable), he said. “A good number of them had hypertension, diabetes, hypothyroidism and even morbid obesity. It’s not just the lungs which are failing due to COVID-19 but these other illness were causing multiorgan failures and shock”The recent go-ahead by the ICMR to begin rapid antibody testing may help step up diagnosis. “Even during swine flu, the fatality rate was quite high for Indore, as some areas in the city are crowded and there is an interplay of factors in each case. With more number of diagnostic tools, including the rapid antibody testing, testing will be stronger,” said Dr. Bhargava. So far, no patient with a “general condition fair” (GC) has had a “general condition unfair” later or admitted to the ICU or died, said Dr. Salil Sakalle, Professor, Community Medicine Department at the college. “Those who died had a highly unfair GC, when the respiratory distress was almost uncontrollable.”Primary contacts of such patients, however, showed no such severe respiratory conditions, so they were responding well, he explained. “For around 30-40% of those who died the COVID-19 positive report came later. They were so serious. There needs to be research around why such patients’ condition has a disposition for COVID-19 reacting so severely in them,” he said. Dr. Sakalle noted some probable causes of the high fatality rate: “They may have a cough and cold for a long duration before they finally approached a health facility. Moreover, from wherever they caught the infection, the viral load could be very high. Again, we are yet to establish all this.”He said the deceased mainly lived in congested localities, where several neighbours developed mild samples which warranted intensive testing."

In fact, I would say if you don’t fall ill, you didn’t perform your duty well,” he chuckles.Different officials may use the same vehicles, sit in the same chairs and use the same protective face masks at different times during the day. “And you don’t know who is carrying the infection,” he said. Only one of the infected policemen is above the age of 60 years. “Young boys in uniform are spindly and lack a strong immune system. They can’t take pressure and long working hours,” a constable chipped in. Violators of ordersThe crime rate remains unaffected, said Mr. Singh, only their nature had changed. “There are violators of prohibitory orders now. And no pickpockets. Who will they target anyway when there’s barely anyone on the roads?” he asked. As efforts to contain the virus spread initially focussed on Indore, where 16 persons have already succumbed to it, the attention has shifted to Bhopal now, where 76 fresh cases were recorded in the past four days. More than 40 health workers, and more than 12 policemen and their family members, have mainly borne the brunt. The police estimate its officials had become ill after coming into contact with around 20 members of the Tablighi Jamaat who tested positive, including four of them in Jahangirabad.Containment areasWith 23 containment areas drawn up and a total lockdown imposed in the city, locals mostly remain indoors. Only to get LPG cylinders refilled, withdraw cash from banks or perhaps desperately look for a provisions store do they step out.On Hanuman Jayanti on Wednesday, the temple in the New Market, which witnesses thousands of devotees thronging to it on the day each year, reopened to the public briefly after two weeks. Scarcely anyone turned up, and those who did offered prayers while standing outside. “We have to be cautious everywhere, be it a temple or home,” said Gaurav Garg, who owns a shop selling spare automobile parts, while carrying his two-year-old daughter in his arm. The temple’s manager, Yogendra Singh Rajput, pointed to a hand sanitiser bottle kept on his table inside. “We don’t want to upset devotees, but at the same time stick to the coronavirus guidelines. Social distancing is the key in combating this disease.”Deserted roadsRoads remain deserted in Char Imli, the residential enclave of bureaucrats where the Principal Secretary of Family Welfare and Health, who has also contracted COVID-19, resides. “Sahab logo ne hume ghar aane se mana kar diya hai (Officers have asked us not to come to their homes),” said Inder Kumar of neighbouring Priyadarshini Nagar, where gardeners and domestic help of the bureaucrats live.“They fear we might be the carriers of the disease,” he said, “but we fear them instead.

The department has also rejigged its deployment strategy, with a focus on dealing with curfew violations and quelling apprehensions about quarantine, as the incidence of normally reported crimes has come down.“Policemen were getting infected at the workplace, and taking the illness to their families, who were then spreading it in the neighbourhood. This way, other places could get infected, too. So, it became important to break the chain of contact between workplace and home,” said Upendra Jain, Bhopal Additional Director General of Police.Declared hotspotsAs cases spiral in Bhopal, 12 policemen and their seven family members have been infected too. The police believe the personnel contracted the illness while on duty within the Jahangirabad and the Aishbagh Police Station limits, where most of the 20 infected members of the Tablighi Jamaat, who had returned from the meeting at the Nizamuddin centre, were found. Their contact is yet to be conclusively established, but the stations have been declared hotspots.Enforcing the lockdown, supplying food to the poor and dispelling rumours, as the threat of infection looms large on each personnel on duty, has sprung a novel challenge for the police. This has prompted an overhaul in the approach, to ensure safety of citizens, while ensuring they don’t get infected themselves.To avert the risk of contracting the illness, personnel can directly reach their beat from hotels instead of reporting at stations first and must observe strict social distancing at police stations, which are sanitised regularly. During patrolling, only one official can ride a two-wheeler and at most two can drive a vehicle. And officials above 55 years, who are more vulnerable, have been deployed at back-up jobs, and not on the frontline.Many frontsThe police, according to Bhopal South Superintendent of Police Sai Krishna Thota, within whose jurisdiction the policemen contracted the illness, are fighting on many fronts — ensuring lockdowns in sweltering heat, acting on calls about people breaking quarantine, stress panics among people and preventing any law and order situations.Regular crime had almost come down to zero since the lockdown was imposed, he said. Now, the police are mostly dealing with curfew violations, accidents and crimes of passion. “But those requiring planning and execution have reduced,” he said.“Stress is inevitable, more so for the police,” he wrote on Twitter, admitting it was a new experience for the administration too. There is the psychological pressure about getting infected, seeing colleagues getting infected, keeping heavily-visited police premises infection-free, the lack of sleep and rest at times, and eating on time.Adapting to challenges“We are in a constant mode of taking action and correcting them, no tried and tested ways are available,” he wrote. The police are adjusting to changing directives as the systems adapt to challenges.Staying away from family fearing you will infect family members adds to the pressure. “We have allowed personnel one meal at their homes, that too while they sit at a distance from the family,” he said.To lend psychological support to personnel, the police have roped in a prominent Bopal-based doctor, who takes counselling sessions for an hour each day to quell their apprehensions about the illness and guide them with ways to combat it.During the outbreak, he said, the police were seeing the difference between policy-making and enforcement. “Once it was decided that vegetables would be allowed to be sold as an essential commodity, the number of vegetable vendors increased. Even tea vendors, cobblers and barbers became vegetable vendors,” he said.On the phoneOn the Dial 100 service, he said, two kinds of calls kept them busy — those with complaints of others breaking a rule or violating quarantine or those complaining of a someone who had returned from abroad, say, even two-three months ago.“People are apprehensive. We get to hear queries about using face masks. Some ask us whether it is okay to step out to visit a hospital for a simple illness. The instruction is clear about that — people can step out only in the case of emergencies,” he said.Exercising further precaution, the police have gradually shifted most coordination work to the phone in the past ten days.

No optionAfter the State government converted the ICMR-run Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre (BMHRC) into a dedicated COVID-19 hospital on March 23, the facility closed its doors to the survivors of the methyl isocyanate leak from a pesticide plant in the city in 1984, which killed thousands and caused deformities and congenital diseases in lakhs. They are now left with no other government-run superspeciality hospital. Tens of patients, including 28 from the pulmonary ward, the most from any department, were shunted out.

His situation worsened every year with the change of season,” said Mr. Yadav. On April 8, even Sanjay Maithil’s 80-year-old father, asthmatic, was denied admission by a private hospital. Earlier he was treated at the BMHRC. “We faced a lot of trouble getting him admitted to both private and government hospitals,” he recalled.Gas tragedy survivors and those with lung ailments are the most vulnerable to the coronavirus, said Tarun Kumar Pithode, Bhopal Collector. “We have designated the BMHRC as the COVID-19 hospital for the survivors only. We have appointed a nodal officer for them too. And private hospitals can’t deny admission. We will act against them.” Two of them died even before they tested positive for COVID-19, and the third wasn’t shifted to the BMHRC even after testing positive.

The claim, however, is raising questions, given the State’s limited infrastructure, testing patterns nationwide and discrepancy with data received from the testing centres.State Helpline numbers | State-wise tracker | A map of confirmed cases in IndiaOn Thursday, nine of the 10 laboratories tested the samples. Going by the number of samples claimed to be tested, each lab in the State, which has reported the third highest number of cases in the country, tested on an average 361 samples. The number is extraordinarily high, as 263 laboratories across the country tested 103 samples on an average on Thursday, according to data from the Indian Council of Medical Research. In New Delhi, boasting the second highest number of cases among the States, 2,179 samples were tested by 18 labs on Thursday, with each lab testing 121 samples on an average.

Also read | All residents of Indore set to be screened for Influenza-Like Illness and Severe Acute Respiratory IllnessThere was a spike, he explained, as the government was receiving results of samples it had sent to New Delhi two days ago. However, even excluding the 642 sample results of Indore residents that were received from the National Institute of Biologicals, Noida, on the day, the jump is beyond the State’s infrastructural capacity. While the media bulletin claims 3,896 results were received on Thursday, Mr. Suleman himself had said then reports of 1,158 samples were received on the day, and they included those received from laboratories in New Delhi. “This is the highest number of samples received on any day,” he said. While the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, Indore, tested 356 samples on Thursday, four laboratories in Bhopal, including the one in AIIMS, cumulatively tested just 388 samples.

As many as 5,000-6,000 people returned from abroad and there were agitations going on in the city in which several people took part.” Indore was one of the major centres of the anti-Citizenship (Amendment) Act agitation within Madhya Pradesh where the police had on one occasion reportedly roughed up some participants too.Mr. Singh asserted, “Mainly this [Coronavirus] has come through flights, the medium being the airport. The situation has come to be because of passengers who came here in January and February.” According to the World Health Organisation, most estimates of the incubation period, the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease, range from one to 14 days, most commonly around five days. The first case in Indore was reported on March 22.Data | The Nizamuddin cluster and the coronavirus spreadSince he was not there in Indore back then, added Mr. Singh, so he did not know what exact measures were in place then. “Now, what directions were there then, what actions were taken then, I couldn’t find the time to find that out,” said Mr. Singh in Indore, which makes up 65% of the 1360 cases and 68% of the 69 deaths in the State.Indore has the third highest number of cases after New Delhi and Mumbai. Recently, the case fatality rate in the city, the largest and the most populous in the State, soared to 12%, the highest in the country.Refuting the claim of Mr. Singh, a health expert involved in studying the pattern of the disease’s spread in Indore, requesting anonymity, said limiting the source of infection to international travel was unjustified. “It does not suffice for Indore, but may be applicable to New Delhi, Mumbai or Kerala which have several flights abroad. Indore has just one to Dubai.”The virus was obviously imported into Indore, he said. Therefore, the generation of it, as a single point of source, remains outside, as it does for any place in India.During contact tracing, experts were going over the possibility of an outbreak effected by a carrier’s indirect contact with someone with international travel history in another city. “Such carriers may have had domestic travel history, bringing the infection from some other city,” he said.Once the virus crept into the community, it transmitted furiously in certain areas that are overcrowded. “The medium of transmission has been strong,” he said."

Akash Tripathi, Indore Divisional Commissioner, said in the coming days the surge was expected to hit a plateau in Indore, which has the third most number of cases after New Delhi and Mumbai, as newer cases were majorly primary contacts of patients, already in quarantine. Unrelenting uptickYet, the unrelenting uptick in the number of deaths in the neighbouring districts of Indore, Dewas, Khargone and Ujjain, which in a combined form make up 85% of the 85 deaths in the State, is confounding health experts. Indore authorities are sending swab samples to the National Institute of Virology, to ascertain if a more virulent form of virus strain was proving more fatal. As of April 23, as many as 28 districts of Madhya Pradesh were prey to the virus, with Indore, having 945 cases, bearing the maximum load. So far, 203 patients have recovered from the illness.

It was the day when Kamal Nath bowed out as Chief Minister, bringing to a close a month-long power tussle in the State. It was also the day when four people tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Jabalpur. Around noon, a political spectacle, long coming, played out at Nath’s residence in Bhopal, atop the Shyamala hills, overlooking the Upper Lake. Among the hundreds of journalists who had assembled there for a press meeting was a 62-year-old man, unknowingly carrying the virus. On the dais, in the open-air hall, stood a sullen set of Ministers. The government had been rocked by desertions from within the ranks. At the centre, a chair and table were set, from where Nath would later announce his resignation. “Please come forward, and closer,” Narendra Saluja, media coordinator for the Chief Minister, gestured to journalists. Chairs were pulled with a screech, and arms and knees rubbed against each other as journalists, perspiring in the heat, huddled together to catch sight of the Congressmen on the dais. “I had no idea I was carrying it,” the journalist, who remained asymptomatic through the 10 days of his treatment, said after his recovery. His daughter, 26, a postgraduate student in London, tested positive on March 22, days after her return. Hers was the first case in Bhopal. Despite being faced with an unprecedented health crisis from March, by when cautious States had already closed down public places, prohibited gatherings, and ramped up health infrastructure and marshalled doctors, Madhya Pradesh was embroiled in political wrangling. The virus was knocking furiously at its gates. By April 12, SARS-CoV-2 had gripped Indore, where 10% of the infected had died, the worst case fatality rate for any Indian city. Worse, it had penetrated the State health unit. By April 24, as many as 110 health officials and their family members were infected in Bhopal. As for the police in Bhopal, 41 personnel and their family members have contracted the illness so far. Coronavirus | Confusion over source of infection in IndoreThe signs of an impending crisis were clear. On March 2, when the Centre issued its fifth travel advisory, the Congress was busy rescuing its MLAs reportedly being held hostage by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at a Manesar hotel. On March 10, abandoning the State’s preparation for the pandemic, Health Minister Tulsiram Silawat was cooped up at a Bengaluru resort with 21 rebel Congress MLAs, who quit later. Until that day, 63 COVID-19 cases had been reported nationwide. By March 16, the virus had infected 126 people and killed two. It had entered 13 States, including neighbouring Maharashtra and Rajasthan. That was when a vexed BJP, sniffing power, chided the Speaker’s decision to adjourn the Vidhan Sabha session, in view of the pandemic’s threat, as a ploy to buy time. A single-man CabinetMadhya Pradesh reacted late to the pandemic owing to Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s zeal for power, claimed Jitu Patwari, State Congress working president. “Otherwise, the State could have been saved. Around the time we planned to procure additional medical equipment, the Health Minister ran away. He had sold himself to the BJP,” he said. On March 4, Nath held the first secretary-level meeting on the illness. The next day, a helpline was set up. Next, the IIFA awards ceremony, Nath’s long-cherished dream, was cancelled. On March 7, schools and colleges were ordered shut. Patwari alleged that the BJP “punctured a moving vehicle”. "

838,Madhya Pradesh,"April 24, 2020 23:37 IST",Other States,India,Coronavirus | Madhya Pradesh runs out of RNA extraction kits,"Madhya Pradesh is fast running out of automated RNA extraction kits and staring at a Statewide shortage in two to three days time in the wake of glitches in the supply chain. The kits, having twice as much output than manual ones, are used in the process to test a sample for COVID-19. The laboratory in the State’s hardest hit city, Indore, which accounts for 66% of the tally, will run out of the automated column-based RNA (ribonucleic acid) extraction kits today. Whereas in Bhopal, the AIIMS and the Gandhi Medical College’s laboratories will run out of stock in another day. Kits at the Bhopal Memorial Hospital and Research Centre will last for two days, as will those with the Jabalpur laboratory. The other six laboratories across the State have low testing rates, according to the State Health Department. Enough machines “We have enough machines. In fact, we can even get more of them. But we have no testing kits,” Health Minister Narottam Mishra told Union Minister for Health and Family Welfare Harsh Vardhan during a videoconference. “If you could send them as early as possible, it will be a great relief to us,” Mr. Mishra added.“We have a problem on the supply side,” said S. Dhanaraju, officer on special duty with the Madhya Pradesh Public Health Services Corporation Limited. “As a result, the testing output is affected. Unsteady supply is expected to continue till the end of this month,” he added. The manual bead-based RNA isolation kits can be used for 12 samples in an hour, whereas the automated ones can be used for 24. The vendors were mostly in Germany or the United States, both badly affected by the pandemic, Mr. Dhanaraju explained. “Companies are not supplying. Moreover, there is demand for kits all over the world. For the bead-based kits being manufactured domestically, procurement of raw material is hit as many components are imported,” he said. The State had placed an order for 1.16 lakh RNA isolation kits, of which it had received just 23,000 kits so far. The manual extraction kits were more or less available, said Ruby Khan, the official managing laboratories for COVID-19 in the State. “We initially had 5,000-10,000 automated isolation kits. We have run out of stock now,” said Ms. Khan, who is a deputy director in the State’s Directorate of Health Services.Testing rates will fall substantially if Indore, where deaths had climbed to 55, does not receive the automated kits soon, said Akash Tripathi, Indore Divisional Commissioner. “We had tested 428 samples on Friday using them. But with manual ones, it will be close to only 200 a day. We had substantially ramped up our testing capacity over time. But we can’t do anything without kits,” he said.An official at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College Indore said the availability of RT-PCR kits was not a problem so far.COVID-19 cases in Indore surged past 1,000 on Thursday night as 84 new cases were detected on the day. So far, the city has recorded 1,029 cases. As many as 82, or 8% of the patients had recovered from the illness, said Pravin Jadia, Indore Chief Medical and Health Officer.Although the case growth rate in the city has declined in the past few days, Thursday saw a renewed surge after April 16, when 244 cases were detected in a day with a backlog of test reports pouring in.According to the State Health bulletin of April 24, Ujjain had reported that 11 of the city’s 102 patients, or 10.7% of all cases, had succumbed to the illness. The toll has surpassed that of Bhopal, the capital city having four times its population. In other neighbouring districts of Indore, six patients have died in Khargone and six in Dewas. The State has recorded 92 deaths and 1,846 cases so far."

The modalities of transportation have to be worked out without room for any chaos,” said an official from the Chief Minister’s Office.

Three out of four patients to die of the illness in the State come from the four districts combined. The alarming trend is prompting health experts to enquire into why 85% of the 99 deaths owing to COVID-19 have occurred in just four of the 52 districts. After Indore, the country’s cleanest city, Ujjain, Khargone and Dewas recorded the most number of fatalities in the State. As of April 25, in Dewas district, having a population of just 15.6 lakh, as many as six, or 27.2% of all patients have died of the illness, registering one of the highest case fatality rates in the country. District’s Chief Medical and Health Officer R.K. Saxena said: “One of the recovered patients was a frequent traveller to a hotspot in Indore.” He unknowingly brought the virus upon seven members of his family, of which three have died. The other three deaths were hastened by co-morbidities. Also read: Coronavirus India lockdown Day 32 updatesIn Khargone district, six or 10% of all patients have died so far. Whereas in Ujjain, 15 of 103, or 14.5% of patients who tested positive had died. The infection has inflicted the worst toll on Indore, where 57, or 5.25% of all patients have died of it. Hospitals stretchedIn the absence of enough government-run tertiary care centres in west Madhya Pradesh, patients from 14 districts are used to seeking treatment in Indore, whose own infrastructure is under stress now. “Our hospitals, both private and government, are overflowing,” said a professor at the government-run Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College (MGMMC), Indore, requesting anonymity. Also read: In Madhya Pradesh, power play during a pandemicThe virus’s spread could majorly be contained by restricting mobility, including that of patients, said Salil Sakalle, associate professor, Community Medicine department at the college. “Shifting every coronavirus patient elsewhere for treatment increases the probability of infecting another 20-25 people, as they are accompanied by attendants too. Therefore patients from neighbouring districts are now being mostly treated there itself unless serious,” he said. Health experts were considering whether carriers had taken the virus from the hotspots of Indore to other districts, said Lokendra Dave, member of the State COVID-19 Technical Advisory Committee. “The virus may have been carried by those violating the lockdown and travelling,” he said. Moreover, he said, many patients were presenting themselves late at hospitals “Around 60 of the 80 initial deaths can be attributed to late reporting. People still do not take cold, cough and fever good enough a reason to see a doctor,” said Dr. Dave. “The fear surrounding isolation further prevented the infected to approach the health system. There is social stigma and phobia attached with the coronavirus,” he said. In addition, the MGMMC, on advice of the State government, is sending samples collected from the four districts, including Indore, to the National Institute of Virology, Pune, to ascertain whether a mutated, more virulent form of the virus is causing more deaths in the region. There was no question of the virus travelling from Indore to neighbours as the lockdown was being imposed strictly, said Akash Tripathi, Indore Divisional Commissioner. “Only for essential services and emergencies are we relaxing it,” he clarified. Still, the virus is spreading to at least two-three new areas every day in Indore, he admitted. “At least 10% of recent cases have come from newer areas. The epidemiological link is that doctors, police personnel and pharmacists, who often work in containment areas unknowingly carry it back to their residential areas.”"

Hospital in Indore. After he was denied an ambulance, his son grabbed their scooter to move him. But as soon as they reached the hospital’s entrance, the man was dead, sitting limply between his wife and son on the scooter. That day his brother, 60, rode beside them on another scooter. And a week later, he too died. Severe cough, unrelenting fever and furious breath. X-ray reports showing identical patches of pneumonia in lungs. Rapid worsening of condition. The brothers showed COVID-19 symptoms, but only the younger man was tested. “If my uncle’s body had been tested for the disease, we could have probably saved my father,” said Rahul Chandne, 34. The hospital, a government-run COVID-19 facility, refused to take in his uncle’s body. As the family carried it back in an autorickshaw, a COVID-19 patient, who may have infected tens, including his brother, in the hardest hit city of Madhya Pradesh, was conveniently forgotten.Mr. Chandne is sure his uncle unknowingly harboured SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing the infection. “He had recently shifted to a house near us. Earlier, he lived in another locality, now a hotspot. The symptoms were initially silent,” he said. As the body was not tested, no contact-tracing was done. This closed the only chance of zeroing in on the brother as a primary contact, isolating him and giving him early treatment. “No one took his swab samples or conducted a blood test even a day before his death, when he visited the hospital showing symptoms, he was given some treatment and sent back. They did not admit him,” Mr. Chandne said. Two days after the younger brother’s death at the hospital on April 22, his report confirmed him positive. A day later, samples were collected from Mr. Chandne, his mother and wife. While two reports are awaited, his mother, who recently had bouts of loose stools, has tested negative. “The irony is that although my uncle was never tested for the illness, the authorities were quick to put up a quarantine sticker outside his and our house. They even tested his wife and son, who turned out negative,” he added. “We are not authorised to collect samples from a body to test for the disease,” said Rahul Rokade, of the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College, which is attached with the hospital. “Only proper contact-tracing of the second man who died can tell us how he contracted it.

Two jail guards and an IPS officer have also contracted the illness from them. Nasir Khan was arrested on April 7 for the assault along with his son Javed Khan. Nasir Khan was initially kept in the same barracks as the other inmates at the Central Jail, said Akash Tripathi, Indore Divisional Commissioner. The government had invoked the National Security Act (NSA) against Javed and three others, and he was sent to the Jabalpur jail with another accused. Only on April 10, when his son tested positive in Jabalpur, was Nasir tested in Indore. When his result came back positive, the 125 inmates in the barracks were moved into a hostel-turned-quarantine centre, said an official of the Jail Department.Although the six arrested for the attack on the constable come from a COVID-19 hotspot, they were huddled up in the jail without being tested for the illness, said an official, of Indore’s COVID-19 combat team, requesting anonymity. Four of the infected inmates were admitted to the MRTB hospital, while the others were lodged at the quarantine centre, guarded by the police, in the Asrawad Khurd area. “Three of them are asymptomatic,” said Mr. Tripathi. Two guards who had handled the father also tested positive. A few days ago, Javed pulled off a dramatic escape from a government-run hospital in Jabalpur while undergoing treatment for the illness. He took a lift on a truck to Narsinghpur district and tried to ride back on a motorcycle to Indore. A police team arrested him at a checkpost. Personnel who had come in contact with him, including a 2017-batch IPS officer, went into quarantine. The officer tested positive later. “Invoking the NSA against them was perhaps right, but immediately putting them in jail, just to show an exemplary action, was negligent,” said the official.

They walk on the railway track during morning, evening and night along with their belongings.The migrants have chosen the railway track apparently to avoid police harassment and being stopped at check-posts on the highways and State borders. “It is not safe to walk on the highway as police could stop us and put up in some unknown location. Hence, we chose to walk along the railway track unnoticed by authorities and it is also easy to identify stations and reach our Balaghat junction and go to our village,” said a migrant labourer Veeresh.He said that they were taking shelter during afternoon in the villages adjoining the railway tracks.

But surviving jaundice had given me the strength to overcome other illnesses, including corona. This experience was nothing before that one,” he asserted. He still does not know how he became infected. As the lockdown kicked in, he barely stepped out; no one in his family or locality contracted the illness. “Sometimes I lent my sons a hand in repairing vehicles,” he recalled. Eight days before visiting a hospital on March 29, he suffered the first bouts of fever, temporarily controlled with self-medication. “He came to us at the peak of his illness,” said Salil Bhargava, a doctor at the Mahatma Gandhi Memorial Medical College who was involved in the treatment. “He carried bilateral pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.”Most of the 68 patients who have died in Indore presented so late at hospitals that the COVID-19 condition had taken complete hold by then, opined health experts. Despite pulling out all stops, it was difficult to save them. “Most who have come to us in Makhmuddin’s condition have died,” observed Dr. Bhargava. “Although the illness doesn’t have a defined remedy at present, his cure shows supportive treatment works. Therefore we should not lose hope,” the doctor said.Cheerful companyAs he showed improvement, Mr. Makhmuddin was moved out of the ICU to another isolation ward. There, he drew support from the company of those recuperating alongside him. Six patients of varying ages occupied beds set wide apart. They chatted away their time, on the road to recovery. “Accha time pass hua udhar. Dil behelta raha (We passed our time pleasantly. We kept ourselves entertained),” he chuckled. Two recently admitted youth, with uncertainty gripping them, had asked him about recovery. “I told them to have patience and the willpower to fight it out,” he recalled."

However, these figures do not include the latest data from Indore. With four more deaths, the State-wide toll rose to 137. Bhopal, Ujjain, Khandwa and Hoshangabad reported one death each, the Directorate said. The day saw 21 persons being discharged after treatment across the State. So far 482 persons have recovered. Most recoveries at 177 have been reported from Indore, where 1,486 cases and 68 deaths have been reported as on Wednesday. But Bhopal, which has a third of the cases of Indore, has notched a better figure proportionally at 162. The case fatality rate in Ujjain stood at 17%, the highest in the State. The most populous and the largest city in the State, Indore recorded a rate of 4.6%. Whereas it was 3% for Bhopal. Meanwhile, Health Minister Narottam Mishra said no patient as on April 30 was on ventilator support in Bhopal, whereas six were being given oxygen support in Indore. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said 65 samples out of 2,617 had tested positive, marking a test positivity rate of 2.5%. In Bhopal, 25 of 1,275 samples, in Jabalpur seven of 157 and in Ujjain 11 of 96 samples tested positive. During a review meeting, Additional Chief Secretary for Health Mohammed Suleman said three districts — Ujjain, Indore and Bhopal remained in the red zone.So far, 35,000 migrant workers who were stuck in different States have returned to the State. Of these, 25,000 had returned from Rajasthan and 6,000 from Gujarat."
854,Madhya Pradesh,"May 01, 2020 20:33 IST",Other States,Bhopal,"Coronavirus | Over 9,000 test reports unaccounted for in M.P.","A wide variance between the cumulative COVID-19 test reports received and the sum of samples that tested positive and negative until April 30 in Madhya Pradesh, has raised questions about accuracy of data maintained by the State government. The difference between the two metrics has left at least 9,271 test results unaccounted. Incidentaly, this figure is close to startlingly high number of 7,875 tests which the State government claims to have conducted on the same day (April 30). This stated number of tests is more than twice the highest number of tests reported earlier. . It also marks an unusual 23.27% jump in testing over the previous day, much beyond the State’s infrastructure. Also read: Coronavirus | Madhya Pradesh man jumps quarantine, gets a haircut and infects sixThe spike in testing numbers helps buttress the claims of the embattled State government, under whose watch 5.2% of COVID-19 patients have died. Ujjain, with a fatality rate of 17% has overtaken every other city in country. However, even as the figures showed a wide discrepancy, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan said the infection rate had reduced in the State, and the situation was improving. On April 30, Madhya Pradesh had conducted 500.3 tests per million, up by around 100 counts over the previous day. In line with Mr. Chouhan’s claim, the number of positive samples among the tested ones continued a downward trend, settling at 6.3% on the day, according to the media bulletin. “We are recompiling this figures. The Indian Council of Medical Research is not sharing the data with us real time. Their database is not available with us. And the data given in the bulletin is collected from laboratories. The laboratories are reporting more,” said a senior official of the State Health Department, requesting anonymity.Also read: Coronavirus cases in Madhya Pradesh’s Indore Central Jail rise to 19The over-reporting in testing comes four days after 8,439 samples were shown in the daily bulletin as pending results. Thereafter, the government scrapped the ‘pending samples’ column altogether. Amulya Nidhi, of the Jan Swasthya Abhiyan, believes this was done to avoid the media questions over the high numbers of pending test results. “The government is manipulating data in varying ways since March 26,” Mr Nidhi alleged. “First, it stopped releasing the tally of rejected samples, and instead combined it with negative samples. Then a month later, it stopped revealing the number of samples collected and the pendency.” The number of total sample test reports received is a sum of positive and negative samples tested. Since April 26, the tally of negative samples has not taken into account the rejected samples, said an official at the department. And since then, the difference between reports received and the sum has been growing. Starting with 1,344 on April 27, it has touched 9,271. In two other recent instances, the government had similarly slashed its cumulative tally of samples which had tested negative. On April 27, the total samples tested until then dropped to 25,665, as 4,679 was subtracted from the tally of negative samples on the previous day. Similarly, 416 was removed on April 18 from the tally until the previous day, thereby dropping the testing count. The bulletin, released every evening, does not take into account figures from Indore, the hardest-hit city where most cases and deaths have been reported. The city releases its figures late night, which are adjusted in the State tally the next day. “As the situation in Indore turned worse, they stopped even revealing who died of COVID-19 and with what co-morbidities, in the city’s bulletin. From a comprehensive bulletine, Indore district administration has made it into a short single-page one,” said Anand Rai, part of the Indore COVID-19 combat team. “The media and the public have a right to access data, and analyse it. It is not like the data is the intellectual property of the government. It must be transparently released so that others could study trends and help the fight to contain the virus’ spread,” said Dr. Rai."

The only member in his family to have tested negative, the man, a blood pressure patient, could not be left behind at home unattended. So, he too was admitted to the hospital along with 20 family members and waited as they were cured one by one. He was the last to step out.“He was worried about catching the infection, and asked me over and over again when they will discharge him,” said his 22-year-old son, who had to stay back for his father, despite being cured five days earlier. The man underwent four tests and all were negative. Whenever a family member walked out, they requested that he be discharged too, but to no avail. Many COVID-19 patients, and their family members complain that private hospitals arbitrarily delayed their discharge. Most had their samples taken four-five times, many were not even informed of the results. A high test pendency earlier and delay in sample collection by private hospitals, claimed district officials, had resulted in patients being discharged late. Ideally, a person has to test negative twice back to back 14 days after the samples are collected to secure a discharge.A 69-year-old man remained admitted at a private hospital along with his family for a month. Their samples were taken five times. “We were told our file was lost. So they took the last two samples again before discharging us,” he said. Another man, 55, is yet to be told the status of his sample taken on April 21.An official in Indore’s COVID-19 team, requesting anonymity, claimed private hospitals were wilfully delaying entering sample details online on the State portal to delay patient discharge and show their bed capacity to be full. “This way they can save expenses and don’t have to admit new patients,” she said. Impacts recovery rateIn Indore, five government-run hospitals and 16 government-backed private hospitals are helping combat COVID-19. Delaying discharge, in the State’s hardest-hit city would mean pulling down the recovery rate. While it was 7.5% as of April 23, it climbed to 22.5 by May 3. District Chief Medical and Health Officer Pravin Jadia admitted that backlog of samples had earlier caused the delay in discharge. “Sometimes it had taken even 10 days. Now test reports are issued the next day.”A 65-year-old gazal singer, suffering from pneumonia, remained admitted to a private hospital for 17 days. Although he was not cured, he had to shell out ₹2.2 lakh for treatment. “He was discharged after the second test and the hospital later called to say he had actually tested positive. We have filed a complaint with the Chief Minister’s Office,” his son said.Similarly, Sanjay Khetpal was kept for 10 days at another private hospital, where he spent ₹1.1 lakh, of which ₹38,900 was ‘item charge’. “Although it is a COVID-19 hospital, they charged me for PPE kits,” he said. Amit Bhatt, Deputy Director Medical Services, at the hospital, said, “We are charging for the kits as we are buying them on our own.”However, Dr. Jadia, the CMHO, said, “COVID-19 hospitals can’t charge for PPE kits.

The next 40 minutes were crucial. As plasma carrying antibodies generated on COVID-19 infection were transfused into her blood, three doctors stood by monitoring her oxygen level and pulse. Over days, her oxygen level had dropped to 88%. The illness turned her lungs completely white-out with pneumonia, though the 26-year-old breathed without discomfort, only a mild cough reminding her she was infected. Ten days after the transfusion, Ms. Jain on Wednesday became one of the first two patients, critically ill after battling COVID-19, to recover after plasma therapy in Madhya Pradesh.For the second recovered patient, Kapil Dev Bhalla, 55, diabetes and his age stacked the odds against him. But the day after the procedure, his need for oxygen per minute dropped by five litres. Two days later, he could breathe without an oxygen mask. The X-ray showed near-complete resolution of pneumonia, explained Ravi Dosi, head of the Respiratory Medicine Department.Also read: Plasma therapy is no silver bulletDuring his 27-day stay at hospital, Mr. Bhalla learnt an invaluable lesson. “Even if the odds are against you, don’t be afraid. Your thoughts should be positive. That can help you overcome any hurdle,” he said. “I just want to thank the donor,” said Ms. Jain, a software engineer, while filling out her discharge slip at the Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, Indore.

They either have to undergo prolonged ICU care or they die,” said Dr. Dosi. But after the transfusion, he added, the patients showed clinical recovery, near complete resolution of radiological signs and their biochemical indicators showed improvement too. The hospital had picked 10 critical patients, primarily based on their oxygenation index, for the therapy. With its efficacy yet to be proven for COVID-19, only four consented.

His wife too, having recovered from the coronavirus, was discharged from another hospital on the day. But his father remains admitted. Ms. Jain consulted her family doctor first. “My friends had donated plasma after their recovery in Ahmedabad. But doctors told me the therapy was still being tried for COVID-19, but had worked for some other illnesses,” she said. With her sister also infected, Ms. Jain suspects they got the infection from their father, who does not know the source."

866,Madhya Pradesh,"May 08, 2020 01:10 IST",Other States,Bhopal,Migrant workers returning to Madhya Pradesh stuck in a double bind,"At the Habibganj Railway Station in Bhopal, the luggage gripped or shouldered by each returning migrant worker screams of the jobs they left behind. Cement sacks, cartons bearing logos of food processing firms, sooty bundles dangling at the end of canes.Sixteen-year-old Uday Pal, barely five feet tall, clutches a dusty sack, bursting at the seams with stuffed clothes, while sitting morosely inside the train. The promise of feeding his family of three back in Sidhi district of Madhya Pradesh, with no agricultural fields to call their own, had snatched him from both his village and his school. Now he was returning, empty-handed. “Sidhi waale aajaao bhai (Those from Sidhi, please come),” a policeman, with a portable speaker slung around one shoulder, bellowed into a microphone. He hailed workers desperately gripping the grills of the train that had reached from Telangana at 8.30 p.m. on Wednesday, bringing back a thousand stranded workers. Children skittishly hopped off the ladder and positioned themselves inside circles chalked out across the platform’s length to observe social distancing norms. “Don’t go outside it. You will catch corona,” said a girl, her two eyes barely visible over a soiled face mask, pulling back her toddler sibling prancing away. ‘To survive’Others sitting inside locked their gaze on Mr. Pal, dolefully stepping out last. The family’s sole breadwinner, his elder brother, after a dispute four months ago, deserted him and a mother, without work to be found locally and having to look after a disabled father. “If we wanted to survive, I had to step out,” said Mr. Pal.A strange mix of emotions weigh heavy on Mr. Pal now — he is happy to be returning home after days of uncertainty, yet sad to be returning so soon. “We thought I could stay there for at least half the year, so that we could manage the rest of the months,” he said. The ₹11,000 he made the first month by working at a fans factory, he immediately sent back home. Like others incapacitated by the lockdown imposed in view of the COVID-19 pandemic later, he too could not foresee what was to come. “I am the last one among my friends to return,” he said. He had still nursed hope of the factory resuming operations in Secunderabad soon. “Many are walking homeward on highways. I didn’t know the language there, how could I find my way back on foot?” he asked, unsure how his family’s life will unfold now.Outside, Vijay Dahiya, 26, slumped in a seat on a Satna-bound bus, murmured absent mindedly: “My village is 50 km away from there. Will they drop me home?” For the first time in seven years, the summer in Telangana ended too soon for him. Working at a tiles factory for six months earned him ₹500 a day. Now, the approaching monsoon remains the only hope. But he will make just ₹250 a day sowing rice on others’ fields. “Isiliye toh bahar gaye the, bhaiya (That is why I had moved outside),” he chuckled. Gripping fearAnother fear grips Lakshmi Prasad Kushwaha, who is returning with his wife to Tikamgarh, 260 km away. “We had eloped a year and a half ago. And had decided never to return because her parents have threatened to kill me,” said Mr. Kushwaha, eagerly showing the marriage certificate stuffed inside the back pocket of his bag. Both made ₹8,000 each a month at a hotel’s kitchen in Hyderabad.However, an outstanding loan of ₹2 lakh taken for crops sown on his family’s five bigha land is a more pressing reason, which pushed his two brothers to Agra and him to Telangana. “There are no jobs back home. We will probably manage working with a vegetable vendor,” he said, just as a health worker, donning a PPE (personal protective equipment) kit, called him for screening before he boarded a bus."

In fact, they made enough money this time.Full coverage on coronavirusBut then the lockdown was announced, scuttling their plan to return in March and draining all their earnings. Before they starved, the family of three decided to board a truck back home paying ₹6,000.“I will go back after the rains. There is no work back home,” said Mr. Jamre, 30, who worked in Junagadh as an agricultural labourer along with his wife. A loan of ₹10,000, taken for medical expenses, is outstanding. And the half-acre land back in Sawariyapani village of Barwani can sustain the Barela adivasi family for only two months.Widespread malaiseThe Jamres are not alone. As thousands of adivasi migrant workers return empty-handed amid the extended lockdown, battling uncertainty and hunger, their villages have little to offer. Their land holdings are small, local agricultural wages are low, payments under the MGNREGA are sluggish and measures to create local employment have faltered — the very predicaments that drove them to leave home for work in the first place.In Gujarat, the workers make ₹300-400 a day, almost three times the wages in Barwani. “Our fathers had meagre plots of land. And now it is divided among four-five brothers,” said another migrant adivasi, 40-year-old Saka Ram.Also read: Coronavirus | Madhya Pradesh caught between pandemic and penuryAs workers boarded the bus to Gujarat ahead of the harvest, each paying ₹700 as fare, they were accompanied by villagers who were stepping outside for the first time. “We get a commission of ₹50 for convincing a villager to come with us. Next year, they will convince others,” said Mr. Ram.Coupled with a faltering economy in the villages and the incentives of working for a decent wage, the number of migrants is swelling each year.“Our forefathers depended mostly on forest produce,” said Valsing Sastia, of Limbi village in the district. “But foliage has disappeared gradually with felling of teak trees for timber.”Also read: Coronavirus | Madhya Pradesh pushes working hours from eight to 12 in factoriesThis time, said Kailash Solanki, the village’s Rozgar Sahayak, around 300-400 more villagers than usual had applied for work under MGNREGA.Delayed payments“The demand has increased now as more workers are returning than before. Under the scheme, they get paid in 15 days, but outside, they are paid the same evening. That’s why they migrate,” he said. Of the 2,380 voters, 887 have MGNREGA job cards.Sawariyapani’s Rozgar Sahayak Suresh Lakdiya Jamre said, “Uncertainty of payments under the scheme drove workers away.” Around 900 households have job cards, while the village's population is 4,000.Also read: Coronavirus | In Madhya Pradesh, power play during a pandemic“If it doesn’t rain enough this time, they will migrate now. If it does, they will migrate after three-four months,”said Madhuri Krishnaswamy of the Jagrit Adivasi Dalit Sangathan. “These are marginal farmers who eke out bare subsistence from farming. It feeds them for only a few months.”Workers in the Nimar region of Barwani, Khandwa, Khargone and Burhanpur districts, were lately moving to work in industries, where conditions were worse, added Ms. Krishnaswamy. “The supply of labour is more than the demand in agriculture locally,” she explained."

He was on ventilator support and succumbed during treatment at a private hospital today,” said a district health official.Sudden surgeThe district, and especially Aurangabad city, has reported a surge of more than 60 new cases in the last three days.At least 25 new cases were reported on Sunday and a further 14 on Monday.The district had recorded its first COVID-19 positive case on March 15. Over the next 45 days, while the number of cases increased, the contagion seemed to be in check as the tally was a little over 50 cases. However, officials observe that in the last week or so, the district has witnessed an alarming surge of more than 220 cases, with a daily spike of an average 25 cases.In Pune districtMeanwhile, at least ten fresh COVID-19 cases were reported from Pune district on Tuesday morning, taking the district’s total tally of cases — including deaths and recoveries — to 2,132, said health officials.The district’s death toll currently stands at 115, with 111 of these — including that of an Assistant Sub-Inspector (ASI) attached to the city’s Faraskhana Police Station — being reported from Pune city and the rural areas, and four from Pimpri-Chinchwad.As per figures given by the Pune Zilla Parishad’s Health Department till Monday evening, there were 1,454 active cases recorded in the district, which included 1,377 cases in Pune city, 65 in Pimpri-Chinchwad, and 12 in Pune rural areas.With the rise in new cases, the active positive cases has increased to 1,464.

873,Maharashtra,"April 22, 2020 23:08 IST",Other States,Mumbai,Coronavirus | Maharashtra to ramp up fight after Centre’s report,"Taking cognisance of a Central report that has projected a staggering spike in COVID-19 cases in Mumbai, Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday directed officials to ramp up the State’s response accordingly. A day after The Hindu reported on a Central report projecting a spike of 6.5 lakh cases in Mumbai by May 15, Mr. Thackeray ordered converting the tertiary care GT Hospital and multi-speciality St. George Hospital into COVID-19 facilities on the lines of Nair Hospital. In a presentation, senior State health officials said Maharashtra’s peak — taken at a doubling rate of 7 as opposed to the Centre’s assumption of 3.8 days — will result in 80,000 to 90,000 cases in the financial capital by May 15. The State is not completely discarding the projections made by the Centre but believes numbers could be restricted to under 1,00,000 by stringent measures, said an official present during the meeting at Mayor’s Bungalow. “We are in the process of ramping up facilities at the GT and St. George Hospitals in line with the decision to convert the tertiary care Nair Hospital into a COVID-19 facility. The decision was taken by the Chief Minister,” said Principal Secretary Manisha Mhaiskar, currently in charge of the State’s response to the pandemic.Earlier, a mathematical modelling study carried out by a Deputy Director General (DDG) rank officer from the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on April 16, projected COVID-19 cases to touch an estimated count of 42,604 by April 30 and jumping to 6,56,407 cases by May 15 in Mumbai alone. The State has countered the methodology and tools used for the latest projection and gap analysis, and raised the “discrepancies” in the modelling with the visiting Inter-Ministerial Central Teams (IMCT).‘Don’t discard figures’During the meeting at Mayor’s Bungalow, Mr. Thackeray urged officials not to discard the Central figures even if they appear to be on a higher side. By substantially increasing contact tracing exercise in slums, the State will be able to achieve a doubling rate of 7 and later to 10, he said. “We are not discarding the Central report completely but are only scaling our response, especially contact tracing, to increase doubling rate to 7 and much higher to 10 by May. This way, the numbers will be controlled,” said an official present during the meet.The Central projections raised a heated debate among experts who argued that the report seems to have completely ignored the State’s efforts to tackle the virus. Subhash Salunkhe, technical adviser to Maharashtra on pandemic control, said: “The projections look as if the virus has a free hand. The aggressive quarantining activities in Mumbai, the lockdown, social distancing, treatment and recovery of patients and the impact of all these efforts have not been factored in at all,” said Dr. Salunkhe, adding that the projections were made when the city’s case doubling rate was at 3.8 days while it had now come to nearly 7 days. A former public health official agreed that predictive mathematical models can be uncertain but questions must be asked how prepared is the State even if 15% of the predicted figures are to come true. “A lot of focus has been given to creating new COVID-19 facilities. It will be sensible if the government takes over private healthcare facilities that already have good infrastructure and a team of doctors who are not working at their full capacity,” he said. Last week, an article published in the Journal of the American Medical Association also pointed to debates on predicting future of the virus. “In predicting the future of the COVID-19 pandemic, many key assumptions have been based on limited data. Models may capture aspects of epidemics effectively while neglecting to account for other factors, such as the accuracy of diagnostic tests; whether immunity will wane quickly; if reinfection could occur; or population characteristics, such as age distribution, percentage of older adults with comorbidities, and risk factors (eg, smoking, exposure to air pollution),” the article said, adding that some critical variables, including the reproductive number (the average number of new infections associated with 1 infected person) and social distancing effects, can also change over time. “However, many reports of models do not clearly report key assumptions that have been included or the sensitivity to errors in these assumptions,” it said."

Hawkers came second with 18 offences, while civilians indulging in undue public assembly ranked third with 10 cases.The police have since Monday deployed special squads to check on those advised home quarantine after being examined at the airport, while random checks are also being conducted all over the city jointly by police and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation personnel."

He and his wife, a retired MTNL employee, had returned from an international trip on March 16 and are home quarantined since. “My wife is a cancer survivor and has been mentally disturbed with all this. As per the government’s instructions, we got screened at the airport and also filled the form given by the Health Department during immigration. I am well aware of the precautions to be taken after returning from a foreign country, and we are following the same.” he said.The harassment, he said, began on Saturday. “The list has 42 names, their address and contact number. It does not specify what the names are about but the ones who received it get the wrong impression that this is the list of infected persons.” Ever since, he has been getting calls from people asking if he has the virus. “We wish to register a complaint to avoid further humiliation, social boycott and embarrassment but since we are quaratined, we can’t do that. However, I have WhatsApped various officers in the police department and my daughter has tweeted it tagging the Navi Mumbai Police,” he said.“A patient’s name will not be disclosed. When one is a suspect, he has a stamp on his hand and it is in the public domain. However, this is a case of a different nature. We will register his application with the cyber unit and enquire into it,” said Navi Mumbai Police Commissioner Sanjay Kumar."

And for those few hours on Tuesday evening, social distancing was nowhere in sight.In a panic reaction reminiscent of 2016, when demonetisation was announced, hundreds of citizens poured out into Mumbai’s streets in the wake of Prime Minister Narendra Modi announcing a nationwide lockdown to combat the spread of COVID-19.The PM, in an address to the country at 8 p.m., declared that India would be under lockdown for the next 21 days to fight the pandemic. With the State already under lockdown since Monday, most shops were shut and only those selling essential supplies were operational on Tuesday.Even before Mr. Modi could finish his address, people rushed out of their homes to stock up on essentials like groceries and medicines.Powai residents descended on the streets in their swanky cars and sports utility vehicles to buy whatever vegetables were available in Powai Vihar market.“Barely a few minutes after the Prime Minister concluded his address, the road in our locality was flooded with headlights of cars searching for parking space in the narrow lane. The vegetable vendors, it appears, were expecting this kind of an announcement because late in the evening they started sorting the vegetables,” said Prakriti Sharan, a research scholar at School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London, who is currently in Powai.“It was saddening to see frail elderly women jostling with people in long queues in front of vegetable vendors. There was no social distancing and it was like all hell had broken loose,” Ms. Sharan said.South Mumbai too saw residents rushing out to vegetable markets and grocery stores in Grant Road, Colaba and other areas, but most shops had run out of stock. Those that did have stock, saw some jostling and pushing. At one shop in Grant Road, a few people volunteered to ask everyone to be disciplined, queue up and maintain distance. Meat shops had run out of chicken and mutton by 9 p.m. Large crowds were also seen at chemist shops. Assurances that these shops would be open through the lockdown did not seem to be working.The civic-run market near Thane railway station observed a sudden surge of customers at around 8.30 p.m. with people buying vegetables to last them as long as possible. Shops had already run out of essentials like milk, bread and eggs by then.“Some of my regular customers are calling to tell me to put aside five litres of milk but I don’t even have half a litre left. If this evening is hectic, tomorrow is going to be worse, as people will flock from the morning itself, when the fresh supply comes in,” a general store owner in the market said.“I have people buying something like six to seven types of vegetables in the biggest bags they have, and making me promise to set aside some more while they return for a second trip. Doing business at a single place for years gets you a lot of regular customers and you can’t turn any of them down,” said Saiprasad Shirke, a vegetable vendor.Similar scenes were witnessed in various pockets of Mira Road and Bhayander. Bakeries saw the maximum crowd as people rushed to stock bread, eggs and milk among other essentials. Police personnel stationed near Maxus Mall who were earlier stopping motorcycles and sending people back home could do nothing to stop people from crowding the streets to shop for essentials.Long queues were noticed at grocery stores in Navi Mumbai, with cars parked all around. These places were almost empty for the past few days with a handful coming through the day to buy supplies. A similar scene was observed in medical stores.Vegetable and milk sellers confirmed that supply was on till Tuesday morning but said they are unsure about Wednesday, despite the State government assuring essential supply. Everyone, including the wholesalers, is still ascertaining exactly what the lockdown entails.Believing that the 21-day lockdown would also mean a dearth of cash, people rushed to ATMs to withdraw money.“My mother panicked so much that she forced me to the ATM thinking we won’t be able to withdraw money in next 21 days,” said Anant Joshi, a Belapur resident.Citizens were seen taking to Twitter, tagging the Mumbai police in tweets about crowds in their localities. The police issued advisories asking people not to panic and also increased deployment on the roads to avoid untoward incidents."

Further, it will be disinfecting all public locations that see crowds. On March 22, a police constable stationed at Kasturba Hospital complained of sore throat and was admitted there for a test for the virus. Even as his reports are awaited, the BMC is taking urgent measures to disinfect hospital premises on priority. On Tuesday, it took up the large-scale disinfection of Nair and KEM hospitals, and a dispensary in Antop Hill. It has drawn up a schedule to disinfect every municipal hospital at a fixed timing, including the crucial Kasturba and SevenHills hospitals. This is being done by the Mumbai Fire Brigade using quick response vehicles that spray a diluted mixture of sodium hypochlorite, a type of bleach which is highly effective for cleaning surfaces. Besides, over the next few days, the fire brigade will also be using the same process to disinfect areas that are still seeing footfall, such as municipal markets and offices. A plan id being drawn up to do so. “Sodium hypochlorite was not available with us in such large quantities but we procured it from our contractor on an urgent basis. Once the hospitals and quarantine centres are done, we will disinfect other establishments that see people turning up for essential services,” P.S. Rahangdale, chief fire officer, said. The civic body’s G North ward office staff also disinfected toilets in Dharavi where people do not have individual toilets and therefore rely on public toilets. Several public representatives like Shiv Sena’s Abhishek Ghosalkar, Bharatiya Janata Party MLA Ameet Satam and Sena corporator Amey Ghole have undertaken disinfection of housing societies in their wards."

Reiterating that the supply of essential commodities like foodgrains, vegetables, milk and groceries would not be affected in any way, Mr. Pawar exhorted citizens across Maharashtra to stop congregating in large numbers at market yards and grocery stores.In a bid to facilitate movement on roads for those employees of companies and industries exempted from the lockdown, the Pune Police will be issuing digital permits. Employees can mail the authorities at Punecitypolice.grievance @gmail.com to secure digital permits, which will be issued after furnishing requisite personal and company details as well as that of the official necessary for the operation of services. If stopped by the police, the employee concerned will need to show a copy of the email with his ID card.The Pune Police have also activated four dedicated WhatsApp numbers to answer queries and entertain requests regarding the lockdown orders with respect to permissions for vehicular movement. The numbers are +91 9145003100, 8975283100, 9168003100 and 8975953100.Cracking the whipMeanwhile, police authorities across the State were seen enforcing the lockdown, often brandishing sticks and using force to drive away two-wheeler and four-wheeler riders and sending them packing to their homes. Police personnel and home guards were seen hitting violators with batons and sticks in Aurangabad, Nashik, Kolhapur and Hingoli, while a mild lathi charge was carried out in Nagpur to break up an assembly of more than five people. In Washim and Parbhani districts, the district administration on seeing heavy vehicular traffic, cracked down on errant drivers, forcing them to turn towards their homes and stay indoors to avoid catching and spreading the novel coronavirus."

Senior police inspector Mahesh Desai, in charge of Unit IX, then contacted the accused as a buyer and said that he wanted to purchase the mask in bulk.”Working on the information, Mr. Desai and his team raided the godown in the early hours of Tuesday and seized 9.6 lakh disposable masks, arresting four accused. Based on the initial questioning of the accused, the Unit IX went on to seize a further quantity of 15.61 lakh masks from another godown in Bhiwandi. Officials said the collective market value of the seized masks comes up to ₹14.13 crore.The four accused have been identified as Mihir Patel (46), Shahrukh Sheikh (23), Balaji Nadar (36) and Ghulam Ali (30). The police said there are several others, including the mastermind of the racket, who are yet to be arrested. “The accused had started buying the masks from wherever they could as soon as the scare first began and had been hoarding it since then. Their intention was to hoard as much as possible, wait till there was an utter scarcity and then start selling them for as high a price as they could. We are ascertaining if they had already started selling them or were still waiting,” Deputy Commissioner of Police (Detection I) Akbar Pathan said.The accused have been charged under the Essential Commodities Act and have been remanded in the Crime Branch’s custody till March 27, officials said."

On Tuesday, it was extended to March 31 by Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, who said a necessary system to ensure the supply of essential services will be in place in the next three days.All major municipal markets in the capital city, Panaji, and the towns of Mapusa, Margao, Vasco and Ponda, which were shut down since Sunday, were allowed to remain open from 6 a.m. to 11 a.m. After holding an all-party meeting, Dr. Sawant said Goa has had no positive cases of the coronavirus and the government wants to keep it that way. While the fish markets were officially shut, some vendors sold kingfish and mackerel for a premium at ₹800 and ₹400 a kg, way above the usual prices. “After taking suggestions from all political parties, we have decided that it is time to take some hard steps. Goa will have a 100% curfew. No shops, including milk, fish, vegetables vendors, will be open. Only government emergency services will be available,” Dr. Sawant said. Admitting that people of the State will face issues, the Chief Minister said the steps were taken for the protection of people’s health.As many people had been unable to stock household essentials, Dr. Sawant informed that given that it was a lockdown with social distancing and arresting community spread being the aim, district collectors and mamlatdars would be meeting to finalise a mechanism to ensure the supply of milk and groceries to the people of Goa. “A system will be worked out over the next two to three days,” he said.Last week, the Goa government had sealed its inter-State borders to passenger and tourist traffic as well as imposed Section 144 of the CrPC to prevent mass gatherings. “Tourists should not come to Goa before March 31. Beaches, restaurants and many public places will remain closed in the wake of COVID-19,” Dr. Sawant said.Leader of the Opposition and Margao Congress MLA Digambar Kamat said the all-party meeting demanded the government to ensure the supply of basic commodities and make sure that no one goes hungry. “I have urged the Chief Minister to address the State as contradictory statements have emerged, creating confusion in the minds of people,” Mr. Kamat said.Goa Forward Party president Vijai Sardesai, who was part of the all-party meeting, said the announcement of a lockdown should have been accompanied by clarity on how people will be provided with groceries. “I told the Chief Minister it is ethically wrong to make the announcement to Goans after 11 a.m. when the markets were shut,” Mr. Sardesai said.Many residents took to social media. “I am in Goa. They told us we would have a one day lockdown on Sunday then extended it to March 25, then to March 31, now finally the whole country for 21 days. They said do not panic and buy. What does my family and pets eat for the next few weeks? We cannot make our food last so long,” a local posted on social media.Another Karnataka native employed with a hotel in Goa appealed to Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa to ensure that people from Huballi, Belagavi and Karwar are allowed to head back to their native villages."

Consumers also have the option of recording their meter readings using the Mahavitaran app. An MSEDCL official said they were following directives issued by the Maharashtra Energy Minister, Nitin Raut. “All our field staff are prepared and on duty to cater to any disruption in electricity. We have set up a total of 17 control rooms across the State,” a senior MSEDCL official said. MSEDCL will also not disconnect the meters of any of their consumers until March 31. A senior MSEDCL official said, “All the bill payment centres of MSEDCL will be functioning. We have taken adequate measures to ensure that social distancing is maintained everywhere. We have also ensured the availability of hand sanitisers at these centres. Other payment centres such as banks will have to take a call on whether they want to provide this service too.” The official said there was an excess supply of power as peak demand had reduced from around 20,000 MW in the first week of March to around 18,000 MW. He attributed this dip to many industries suspending operations due to the lockdown imposed across the State. The MSEDCL is the State’s largest power distribution company and caters to nearly 2.6 crore consumers."

Hundreds of people poured out on the streets even before his address was complete to stock up on groceries and other essentials, as there was scant clarity over availability of essential commodities.By Wednesday, several delivery portals started sending messages to their customers, stating that they were unable to deliver goods due to “unforeseeable circumstances”. The Mumbai Police, after being apprised of the situation, started getting in touch with representatives of these platforms.“We are talking to officials from e-commerce platforms like Big Basket, Nature’s Basket and Grofers and understanding the issues faced by them while delivering to their customers. We are also getting details like the outfits worn by their executives and conveying to all police station personnel, so that the executives can go about their jobs unhindered,” Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said.Mr. Ashok said the other option being discussed at the moment is to provide stickers or banners for vehicles ferrying supplies to the loading centre of these platforms, so that their supply, too, is uninterrupted.Attempts were being made to reach out to as many delivery platforms and have one-to-one conversations with their representatives to ensure a smooth delivery system for essential commodities.“The idea is to minimise the need for the common man to step out of doors. There might also be some confusion about the rules of the lockdown, which may need to be cleared first. Doubtless, safety and sanitisation measures while delivering the commodities to the customers will also be part of the discussions,” Mr. Ashok said."

He sleeps at the crematorium worrying about one thing — that the virus from the two coronavirus (COVID-19) deceased who were cremated there could be lurking around. “We have followed all the infection control measures but there is so much news about the virus that it is difficult to shed the fear,” said Jawaharlal Rathod (36), a death registration karkun (DRK) at the crematorium.Also read | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India“I am in charge of the paperwork and therefore I come in contact with the relatives, ambulance drivers,” said Mr. Rathod, who has been using sanitisers and washing his hands at a regular interval as advised by the medical officer.First fatalityOn March 17, when a 64-year-old man’s body wrapped in a leak-proof plastic and cloth arrived at the Shivaji Park crematorium, the other staff was tense. The deceased, who was Maharashtra’s first COVID-19 fatality, was brought in a special biohazard vehicle and an hour before it arrived, the medical health officer briefed the staff on infection control protocol. “I have handled many unclaimed bodies. I have also handled bodies of HIV and TB patients. But this time, we were asked to be extremely cautious as very little is known about the new virus,” said 47-year-old furnace operator Anil Thakur, who handled the first deceased along with two labourers on duty. It was a first for them to wear aprons, gloves, goggles and masks while handling a body. “Soon as the vehicle arrived, the body was taken to the furnace. We were told that there should be no delay anywhere,” said Mr. Thakur, adding that his wife became extremely paranoid when she learnt about it. “Since that day, she had been constantly reminding me to wear the protective gear properly and be careful,” he said.Watch | Your COVID-19 queries answered | Watch | What is contact tracing?‘Responsibility key’Another furnace operator, Nitin Nagotkar who handled the second patient’s body said there was always a slight fear. “But we understand our responsibility is crucial,” he said.The Centre’s guidelines on dead body management state that the ash does not pose any risk and can be collected to perform the last rites. But as a precautionary measure, the ash was also disposed by the crematorium staff in these cases.Mumbai has recorded death of four patients who tested positive for COVID-19. While two bodies were cremated at Shivaji Park, the third was cremated at the Chandanwadi crematorium in south Mumbai. The fourth patient, a Philippines national, was an Islamic scholar who was visiting Indian mosques. Since the last two samples before his death were negative, his case has not been labelled as a COVID-19 death. A Muslim trust in the central suburbs that was first approached by the civic body turned down the request for his burial. “They feared that if the news got out, the community members will not turn up for the badi raat that is coming soon,” said an official, adding that the burial was then carried out in another location. “The staff there too was apprehensive. But we counselled them and convinced them that all the infection control measures were in place,” the civic official added.The Centre’s guidelines state that there is unlikely to be an increased risk of COVID-19 infection from a dead body to health workers or family members who follow standard precautions while handling the body. The guidelines, however, say that large gatherings should be avoided."

He added that shopkeepers can keep their shops open only if they agree to enforce precautionary measures such as social distancing to protect the health of their customers.Mr. Thackeray held a meeting with top bureaucrats to discuss the situation in the State after the announcement of the nationwide 21-day lockdown to counter the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country.A senior bureaucrat, who attended the meeting, said, “It was observed that despite the lockdown being announced, shops selling essential commodities are witnessing huge crowds. We need to avoid this as much as possible and therefore in the meeting with senior bureaucrats, a decision to allow shops to remain open for 24 hours was taken.” The State government also announced a slew of decisions after receiving several complaints from different quarters.Threat of legal action The government threatened to take legal action against house owners and housing societies denying entry to tenants and residents who are doctors, nurses and other professionals working in the medical sector. In a statement issued on Thursday, the State government said doctors, nurses and officials from the Health Department are playing a crucial role in the fight against the novel coronavirus.

Chief ministers of Punjab and Jharkhand reached out to Mr. Thackeray seeking help to rescue migrant workers, devotees, truckers and several others stuck due to border controls imposed in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown. Mr. Thackeray assured help and took action, senior officials of the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said.‘Minimise inconvenience’Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh this week had requested Mr. Thackeray to ensure the return of Sikh devotees stranded due to cancellation of trains in Nanded. Mr. Thackeray then directed the Nanded district administration to minimise the inconvenience caused to devotees bound for Amritsar. “The Nanded Administration has taken care of their stay and safety in Nanded while their food has been taken care of by the Gurudwara Board,” Mr. Thackeray tweeted in reply to Mr. Singh’s request. Meanwhile, Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren appealed to Mr. Thackeray to help 63 migrant workers stuck in Navi Mumbai as they could not board trains to Jharkhand. “The Chief Minister informed Mr. Soren that the workers should stay where they are to avoid the spread of COVID-19. He then directed the local administration to look after the workers,” an official said.Tharoor tweets requestCongress leader and Thiruvananthapuram MP Shashi Tharoor too reached out to Mr. Thackeray and pointed out that a large number of truck drivers from Kerala were stuck on roads after delivering fruits and vegetables in Gujarat. They are held up in Bhiwandi without food, water or toilet facilities, he said. “Could Maharashtra Govt kindly instruct police to allow them to go toKerala? Their conditions are poor and police are behaving inhumanely. Please help.

891,Maharashtra,"March 27, 2020 01:16 IST",Mumbai,Shubha Sharma Mumbai,The real warriors: city’s good Samaritans unable to take help to people yet,"As with every crisis the city has faced over the years, this time too, its real warriors have come out to help those without the means to fend for themselves. While individuals have signed up as volunteers to deliver food and medicines to those needing it, not-for-profit organisations have arranged for food to be delivered to the communities they work with, often raising funds on social media and crowdfunding platforms.While their intent is noble, roadblocks have sprung up overnight, taking many of them by surprise and halting their efforts.“Getting money is easy, giving food is not,” says Luis Miranda, chairman of the NGO, Coro.Coro has identified people in the slum areas of Chembur, Govandi, Mankhurd and Vashi Naka. “We were told not to give money, but to give supplies,” said Mr. Miranda, but as he and his team soon realised, this was the beginning of their worries.“We put up a campaign on (crowdfunding site) Milaap, but that was the easiest part. They were very supportive, didn’t charge us a fee. But the big challenge was, how to get the food?” he says.Retail stores are facing a staff shortage, and police is stopping volunteers, sometimes beating them up for being out during a lockdown. Staffers are either saying they do not want to risk coming to work or their families are not letting them do so. “On the supply front, there is a shortage. Transportation is not available to supply the food packets, so how do we deliver from the store to the community?” he asks.“Groceries are waiting to be delivered, but the police is treating this as a complete curfew, not allowing anyone to do anything,” says Arun Kumar, CEO of Apnalaya, which primarily works in the Shivaji Nagar slum of Govandi.Apnalaya has started a consortium of seven NGOs to generate resources to help communities cope with the immediate crisis, work with the government to create partnerships for long-term relief and network with other NGOs to broad base the effort. “We need to have a greater coordination between government and civil society organisations. The government cannot reach every nook and corner of the city,” says Mr. Kumar.In about a fortnight, he hopes, things will ease. “If just the logistics are taken care of, the task will be easier. We may now have to think of two to three months’ supply.”Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action (YUVA), which has delivered basic provisions to 940 households (over 4,700 people) over the past few days, is publicly appealing for body suits for its team on the ground that is leading the distribution effort. Doel Jaikishen, manager, communications, says they are also seeking access to large transport services (trucks and tempos), “to deliver a larger quantity in a single round.”“We are reaching out with food kits to daily wage earners and their families, based on a rapid assessment we conducted earlier among 34 settlements across Vasai Virar, Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and Panvel where YUVA works. We are giving a week’s ration at a time, but we see this as a long-term relief effort,” says Ms. Jaikishen.Dealing with the system Larger volunteer-based efforts, in that sense, are at greater risk with their people going from place to place delivering supplies, as Project Mumbai is doing.“My volunteers are going around with food packets. I have told them if you can step out, do so, else don’t,” says Shishir Joshi, chief executive officer and co-founder, Project Mumbai."

At many places, vegetable vendors have been shifted so that people don’t crowd in one place.Soon after the State and the Centre announced a lockdown, Mumbaikars stepped out in large numbers to stock essentials. As large crowds were seen outside stores or near vendors, there was criticism that this was exactly the kind of thing people were supposed to avoid.

Many had red-flagged this as a potential flashpoint for a rapid spread of COVID-19.The Supreme Court is seized of a suo moto petition to prevent outbreak and rapid spread of COVID-19 in prisons due to overcrowding, The Home Department had appointed a high powered committee comprising the chairperson of the State Legal Services Committee, Principal Secretary (Home) and DG (Prisons) to determine which class of prisoners can be released on parole or interim bail. Thursday’s meeting led to a finalisation of this decision."

Their condition is stable. Fourteen others who have direct exposure to these three have been placed in quarantine after contact- tracing,” Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said.Health Minister Vishwajit Rane said the government was following all the guidelines laid down by the Central government and taking all precautions. Our own testing facility will be up and running in two days. Our team of doctors are doing their best to make sure we contain the spread of the virus in the State,” he said.Meanwhile, Goa Forward Party president and former deputy chief minister Vijai Sardessai crticised the government’s abject failure in providing groceries and essential commodities to Goans. He said, “People have been suffering for the last two days. This makes us demand that all groceries be categorised as essential commodities as per Centre’s guidelines and social distancing be also enforced.” The Congress’s leader of opposition, Digamber Kamat, called upon Governor Satyapal Malik’s intervention. “I am confident his intervention will bring relief to the people of Goa. I once again appeal to all the people to follow social distancing,” Mr. Kamat said.In a related development, a Goan advocate petitioned before the High Court on account of scarcity of essential commodities and lack of a mechanism to provide basic food supply to vulnerable wage workers. The petition filed by Rohit Bras de Sa said the people of Goa are struggling to find even basic goods to sustain themselves in curfew days. Meanwhile, the Goa University in a notification indefinitely postponed all examinations. Govt. bows to pressure After facing widespread criticism, the Goa government late on Thursday announced that all shops and establishments dealing with groceries, vegetables and other essential supplies would be allowed to stay open from Friday Addressing a press conference, Chief Minister, Dr. Pramod Sawant said the decision was taken as a section of people and opposition MLAs were criticising his government for imposing a total lockdown. “The idea behind a 100% lockdown was to cut the spread of the coronavirus. We have three confirmed cases. There are two cases in Bengaluru and Shimla who had travelled from Goa. There are also many who have not followed home quarantine as required. The government has taken a note of all this. If there is a spread in cases, then it is not because the government did not act, but because people were careless. There are people who have taken to social media to criticise me personally. Our decisions have always been in the best interest of Goa,” Dr. Sawant said."

Tated has been constituted to hear matters during the pandemic.The court had received a letter from senior advocates Janak Dwarkadas, Rajani Iyer, Anil Anturkar, Mihir Desai and Gayatri Singh, requesting that it exempt the petitioner from being be present to sign and affirm the petition, particularly in case of public interest litigations on appropriate undertakings, and allow e-filing of petitions. They also asked that petitions be heard be regularly through videoconferencing, and the grievances of the poor and marginalised are given priority and with sensitivity.The Bench said, “The registry informs us that matters are being entertained even if presented directly in court without affidavit or court fee. No procedural issues/ objections are being raised. Facility of e-filing is already available and hearing through videoconferencing can also be availed, as that arrangement has already been made since about last one week.” It said that urgent matters on request are being attended to, and parties can make request for urgent hearing through email or other modes. “Two courts are already notified for hearing such matters, the dates of sitting are also notified. The registry also informs us that in extreme urgent matters, even at the eleventh hour, parties can move court for appropriate interim order.”Extending all interim relief orders till April 30, the court said, “All interim orders passed by this High Court at Mumbai, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Panaji as also all courts/tribunals and authorities subordinate over which it has power of superintendence expiring before April 30, shall continue to operate till then. It is clarified that such interim orders which are not granted for limited duration and therefore, are to operate till further orders, shall remain unaffected by this order.”The Bench said that orders or decrees for eviction, dispossession, demolition already passed by any court/ tribunal/ authority shall also remain in abeyance till then.It added, “Considering the prevalent shutdown and other issues, we hope that government as also municipal authorities and other agencies or instrumentalities shall also be slow in taking any coercive steps so as to drive the citizen to court of law in the meantime.”"

The BMC also requires more oxygen cylinders for the isolation centres it is setting up. Vishwas Mote, assistant municipal commissioner, said, “We want PPE, Azithromycin 500mg, food packets, and ventilators. Donors can get in touch with me at Andheri Sports Complex.” According to BMC data, its municipal hospital stores have 50 oxygen cylinders, while the requirement is 555; only 3,742 PPEs against the requirement of 35,000; and just 65,293 N95 masks though the need is 1,15,800. There is sufficient stock of Gamex gloves, Nitrile gloves, 3-ply masks, ventilators and hand sanitisers, but due to lack of coordination between hospital management and contractors, it has not yet reached the stores.Civic hospitals place orders with the BMC’s central purchase department (CPD) and the contractor makes the delivery. Despite complaints of shortage of N95 masks and gloves, the department said as on March 27, it has enough stock. However, there is stock of only 35,000 PPEs and no surplus.A senior CPD official said, “There is no shortage at all, but we are hoping to receive more PPEs soon through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives. In some cases, since trucks are stranded on the State’s borders, contractors have not been able to make deliveries. We have intervened and ensured their release.”Deputy municipal commissioner (health) Ramesh Pawar denied reports of shortage of masks. He said, “It is not so. Today, we held a meeting with all medical superintendents and deans, and have given them a free hand. Vendors and systems are in place. They can place orders and take whatever they need. CSR is just a bonus and we depend on it only for 10% requirement.”On hospitals not yet receiving supplies, Mr. Pawar said, “It is the job of the medical superintendent to make purchases and ours to make them available. They will not face any shortage. The major hospitals don’t have a single COVID-19 patient. All are at peripheral hospitals, but the supply is going to major hospitals.”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “In Kasturba Hospital, we have 1,500 PPEs, sufficient N95 masks, and 17 jumbo oxygen cylinders. We have placed orders for 555 cylinders and so far 50 have been delivered. They will be used for peripheral hospitals, where we are setting up 1,030 isolation beds. Those will be delivered by March 30.”‘Adequate supply’On the lack of co-ordination, Mr. Kakani said, “We have assigned CPD staff in major hospitals to issue orders, obtain signatures, ensure supply and payment. Only those treating patients should wear PPE, but when doctors are working in three shifts, we are providing 100 PPE daily. Kasturba Hospital has 1,500 PPE. We have adequate supply and hospitals should use them judiciously. Shortfall is there because there is a strain on manufacturers, but we have planned up to April 30.”In a letter to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, the Maharashtra Association of Resident Doctors (MARD) had highlighted the risk medical students are facing due to lack of PPE. MARD said five medical students, who worked at the international airport, SevenHills and Kasturba hospitals, were quarantined for having COVID-19 symptoms. Dr. Shariva Randive of MARD said, “The letter made a difference. There are enough masks and PPE now. We are now working with the government.”"

The idea was to have lesser number of vehicles, not exceeding 150, which could be managed well in the wake of the novel coronavirus outbreak. Kailas Tajne, a vegetable vendor, said there were at least 5,000 buyers and 2,000 traders at the market. “When farmers send their produce, we can’t say no to them. The control room set up to tackle the issues is located in the head office. The officers who are supposed to be in the field are not available at 2 a.m. when the market opens.”Anil Chavan, secretary of APMC, said they were expecting only 200 trucks. “But since the market was shut and there was excess stock with farmers, many of them sent across. Usually traders call for the stock as per requirement, but some of the farmers sent even without asking for it and we could not deny them. We had planned to take in the vehicles only till 4 a.m., but it went on till 6 a.m..” From Saturday, Mr. Chavan said, they had planned to allow 100 vehicles at a time to avoid crowding. “Meanwhile, we have hired an additional 50 security guards and have also received extra policemen for bandobast.”The police have been doing their job well but overcrowding puts management off track, said Ashok Shiledar, a mathadi worker. “Only 20 % of the mathadi workers are available for work. We are hungry; we are not provided with snacks and tea.” Traders have also claimed that the sanitisers had gone out of stock and after a point, sanitisation of the vehicles and men were stopped. Konkan divisional commissioner Shivaji Daund said, “From Saturday, around 100 policemen will be available for bandobast. The unexpected crowd poses a challenge.

The party claimed that it inspected ration shops across Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad and found them closed. It has asked the State government to ensure functioning of the PDS systemSince the nationwide lockdown, which began earlier this week on March 25, to tackle the novel coronavirus outbreak, the State government has announced that every person in need will be provided three months’ ration for subsistence. “To ensure that the distribution of rations is smooth, the AAP volunteers went on a quick inspection of ration shops across a few cities. We found that a vast majority of the ration shops are closed, and even those that were open were short on supply,” said Dhananjay Shinde, State unit secretary, AAP.Mr. Shinde said cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur, and Pimpri Chinchwad have a substantial population of migrant labourers and daily wage workers, who are the worst hit due to the lockdown. “It is imperative that ration shops remain open,” he said.Among the localities inspected by the AAP volunteers include Nashik (Kothe Galli, Panchavati), Pimpri Chinchwad (Akurdi, Pimpri), Pune (Hadapsar, Bhekrai Nagar- Phursungi), Aurangabad (Gulmohor colony, Bhadkal Gate, Jyoti nagar, Satara Parisar, TV Center, Garkheda, Shivaji Nagar), Latur (Manjri villege, Tandulja), Nagpur (Reshim Bag, Medical Chowk, Mahal & Itavari).The party said that the Delhi government is providing food proactively for four lakh people who are in distress through Delhi Urban Shelter Board and 525 food and relief centres including night shelters and requisitioned schools.“We therefore urgently request the Maharashtra government to make supplies available at all ration shops across both urban and rural areas and ensure that these shops are actually open.

Ever since the government started taking precautionary measures against the novel coronavirus, we realised that it will impact the homeless and the extremely poor in slums,” said Vijay Kharat, senior project associate with YUVA.YUVA ran an online campaign called ‘Together We Can’, appealing to individuals to donate generously for the cause. The organisation then conducted a survey in bastis (slums) to find those who are actually in need of this help. “We took the details of those individuals and after identifying them, gave them coupons. The coupons were meant to make the process easy and hassle-free,” said Marina Joseph, another senior associate.Those who were given coupons were called at a designated place at a given time. The packets being given to families include 5 kg rice, 5 kg wheat, 2 kg dal, masala and a one-litre oil packet, along with detergent and hand soap. Till now, 800 such packets have been distributed to slums in Nerul, Panvel, Belapur, Mankhurd, Jogeshwari, Bandra, Malad, Nalasopara and the homeless in Matunga, Kurla and Kharghar with whom the organisation is already working on various projects. A small group of volunteers go to the assigned spots to distribute the packets. YUVA had conducted a survey of around 1,500 families before going ahead with the distribution.

906,Maharashtra,"March 28, 2020 23:59 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,Glimmer of hope: BMC plans community centres,"“We have always had a water problem, but it was never this bad,” says Radha Rajput, who lives with five other homeless families in Charni Road, adding that they were having to literally beg for water for their daily needs.“Since the lockdown, only one toilet is open. That too for barely 30 minutes in the morning. As soon as the queue increases, they shut it down,” she said. Her story is similar to that of nearly one lakh people across the city, who do not have access to even basic needs such as water or electricity. Brijesh Arya of the Beghar Adhikar Abhiyan said that homeless communities have been badly hit on several fronts. “While food is an issue, it is water that is a major concern. Most homeless people don’t have access to water and usually rely on local shops, railway stations, temples or mosques to cater to their daily needs. The other issue is toilets, as many have shut pay and use toilets out of fear,” Mr. Arya saidJayashree Bhoj, additional municipal commissioner, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), said they were planning to rehabilitate families in eight community centres spread across the city. She said schools were also being looked at a possibility by officers at various BMC wards.Mr. Arya said he welcomed the move to rehabilitate the homeless but all of them should be provided with health check-ups once they were in the community centres or schools and proper social distancing should be facilitated. Sitaram Shelar from Centre for Promoting Democracy said they had come to know that at the ward level, efforts were being made to open up schools for the homeless as well. “We don’t want them to fill schools beyond a point as that would defeat the purpose. The other crucial thing they should take care of is that families should be rehabilitated together as a unit, with their belongings, and not be separated,” he said. With the city staring at a 21 day lockdown, several prominent organisations have started mobilising resources to provide basic food items for the worst affected by the economic lockdown such as homeless communities and daily wage labourers, but faced major hurdles by way of mobility and travel restrictions.  According to the 2011 census, in Mumbai alone, the population of homeless is 57,415. Mr. Arya said that today the real number easily exceeds one lakh, most of whom depend on daily wage jobs, hawking or small businesses. Ms. Rajput said she and others were primarily in the business of stitching flowers for gajras and torans. “Our biggest day to earn is Gudi Padwa, where historically we earn at least ₹1,000. With that gone and all other avenues of income shut, we have literally nothing left,” she said.‘Distribution an issue’“Distribution is a major issue as homeless communities are scattered across the city in large and small clusters and in some cases it’s just individual families,” he said, adding that there could be as many as 300 clusters spread across the city. “Communication is the other major issue as people living in these homeless communities used to charge their phones in shops. With the lockdown, several had been unable to charge their phones and we have lost touch with them,” he said. Since the lockdown, Mr. Arya, said that he had managed to visit a only a few homeless communities on Friday after nearly five days.In some wards, BMC has also started to provide cooked meals to the homeless, but activists feel that that issue was spread across the city and needed a citywide response by the BMC or the State government till the lockdown was lifted."
907,Maharashtra,"March 31, 2020 01:25 IST",Mumbai,Kennith Rosario,People from Northeast face racist slurs amidst coronavirus lockdown,"It’s not uncommon for 35-year-old Chongpi Kipgen to be called ‘coronavirus’ when she steps out for groceries in her neighbourhood in Ulwe, Navi Mumbai. Hailing from Manipur, she has noticed a rise in racist attacks and discrimination against people from the Northeast living in Mumbai, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.“Before the lockdown, they used to call us Nepali, chinki, momo or chowmein, but now they look at me and say, ‘Go corona’ or blame me for eating animals that caused the spread of the virus,” says Ms. Kipgen. During the lockdown, discrimination is widely encountered while grocery shopping, where people distance themselves from Ms. Kipgen or ask her to go to the end of the queue. “They make faces or shopkeepers tell me sarcastically to go home and that they will deliver the food to us,” she says.Zohmangaihzuali Kuri, a 38-year-old model coordinator from Mizoram, who has been living in Mumbai for close to two decades, says that people from the Northeast are often confused with the Chinese and have to prove their Indian identity. “Even though Mumbai is a very safe city, people are treating us very differently,” says Leo Tharmi Raikhan, a 34-year-old resident of Kalina, Santacruz, who hails from Manipur.Apart from racial discrimination, several people from the Northeast, especially from Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, work in the unorganised or service sectors like spas, salons, beauty parlours, restaurants or hotels, and are struggling to make ends meet. Ms. Kipgen, who works in a salon in Vashi, is dependent on the tips she gets from her customers, in addition to her salary. “In the salon or spa industry, we don’t make much money and now with no salary, we don’t know how to pay the rent or buy groceries,” she says. Ms. Kipgen has struck a deal with her landlord to cut the rent from her deposit money but has to pay the deficit in May.Jangchon Lhouvum, chairman of Kuki Worship Service Mumbai, who moved to the city from Manipur, along with other community members like Mr. Raikhan are seeking help from the State government for people from the Northeast with basic grocery supplies and with a means to defer paying their rents.“Before the lockdown, many of us managed to go back home, but now that’s not possible,” says Mr. Raikhan who downed shutters on his salon and spa in Kalina after the lockdown. He has been living in Mumbai for nearly two decades, and according to him, in Kalina alone there are close to 350 families from Manipur, Mizoram and Nagaland, and most stay in rental homes in Juhu, Vakola and Khar Danda. A member of the Tangkul Welfare Society, Mr. Raikhan is advocating for funds for the community.“If we can’t be helped with groceries, I hope the government can arrange a way for us to go back home,” says Ms. Kipgen. Unable to send any money home, the challenge for her is not only to survive the lockdown financially but also endure the growing discrimination because of her appearance."

For this, it has converted its high-tech command centre into a ‘war room’ from where authorities can monitor operations to check the spread of the contagion.“The integrated dashboard will be monitoring quarantine facilities, track the health of suspected patients and their contacts placed under home quarantine,” said Rubal Agarwal, additional municipal commissioner and chief executive officer of PSCDCL.The disaster management cell of the PMC will also provide help to quarantined people through a helpline.“The PSCDCL is using Geospatial Information System for tracking and monitoring the areas and create buffer zones where patients are diagnosed positive with the COVID-19 infection. This helps to implement the containment plan as per government guidelines. The mapping of the containment zones will reflect in the dashboard,” Ms. Agarwal said.The mobile application, which is called Sayyam, has been developed to provide comprehensive online support to quarantined people, said an official from the PMC’s IT cell.“The PSCDCL has also provided free Wi-Fi to those kept in the isolation centres. A massive awareness campaign is being carried out through social messaging on VMD screens, social media and the PMC website. Citizens can get updates on pmc.gov.in/covid,” the official said.The command centre already has the advanced technology in place to see various functions on screen at a click, so with some tweaking it could leverage the technology in supporting the war against the virus.PSCDCL had constructed the command and control centre three years ago to monitor various smart elements, such as variable message display screens, public announcement systems, emergency call boxes, municipal functions including street lighting, monitoring of bus movements and CCTV cameras for security. As the coronavirus hit the city, this command and control centre has diversified.Meanwhile, the PMC has opened relief camps at 15 civic-run schools to halt the exodus of thousands of migrant workers from the city and provide them with food and shelter.Ms. Agarwal said the schools had been converted into temporary shelter homes to accommodate the workers, while stating that social distancing norms were being strictly maintained in these places."

With reports coming in of people crowding vegetable markets in the city every morning, Mr. Pawar on Tuesday warned the buyers of dire consequences.“There have been reports that people are crowding vegetable markets, violating all rules and regulations. This defeats the whole purpose of a lockdown. At a time when corona-positive patients are increasing in the State, there is need to follow the lockdown strictly, which doesn’t seem to be happening,” said Mr. Pawar.He was reacting to reports from vegetable markets across Mumbai where people throng to pick up fresh vegetables. “The government is seriously considering taking harsh steps to stop the irresponsible behaviour of some people. We are warning violators of the lockdown to be ready for any extent of government action. There will be no sympathy for those who break the rules,” said the deputy CM.Mr. Thackeray, on the other hand, has been addressing the State through social media everyday, maintaining a calm demeanour even while addressing violators of the lockdown. He has been asking them not to venture out into the streets unless it is absolutely necessary, or face action. Despite his appeals, a number of market places are witnessing crowds, as a result of which, Mr. Pawar has decided to issue strict warnings.While congratulating those who are following the State’s directions, Mr. Pawar said the government machinery is working overtime to stop the spread of coronavirus. “But certain individuals, instead of cooperating with the government, are creating an unwanted situation.

A much bigger Tablighi Ijtema (congregation), with an estimated attendance of around 45,000 delegates, was to be organised in Vasai, neighbouring Mumbai, on March 14 and 15.However, the Home Department moved swiftly in the first week of March and convinced the organisers to call off the event. Confirming this, Home Minister Anil Deshmukh, in an exclusive interview with The Hindu, explained how the government realised the inherent danger of such a huge gathering well in time and negotiated with the organisers to cancel the programme.Also read: Explained | Who are the Tablighi Jamaat?“The State government was alert to the spread of novel coronavirus in Maharashtra, and we were keeping a close watch on the havoc created by it in the world outside. When we realised that a gathering of over 45,000 people at one place for two days could be a great health risk, not only to them but to others, we decided to take firm action,” Mr. Deshmukh said.“When Maharashtra Police can cancel the permission, why couldn’t the Delhi Police?” he asked, referring to the Tablighi Jamaat in Delhi, now being seen as one of the hotspots for the spread of the virus. Mr. Deshmukh said the event should not have taken place.On January 22, one Abdulkayyum Abdulahad Azmi, representing Shamim Education and Welfare Society, applied to the Manikpur police station in Palghar district for permission to hold the Tablighi Ijtema on March 14 and 15.The local police station, while granting the permission February 5, asked organisers to follow all relevant rules and regulations vis-à-vis noise pollution, traffic, fire fighting equipment, and keeping ambulance on standby.“The State government had begun preparations to counter corona from the first week of March itself. This event was brought to our notice then,” said the Minister.On March 6, Manikpur police station cancelled permission for the Ijtema, clearly specifying that the sole reason for cancellation was the spread of coronavirus. “You have informed us in writing that the Ijtema will be attended by over 40,000 to 45,000 people. Such a huge gathering may lead to the spread of coronavirus,” the police said.Mr. Deshmukh said the organisers initially protested and wanted us to give permission for the event. “They even came to my office to meet me and seek permission. But we were firm that no such event would be permitted,” he said.“It was a team effort, and we could avert a possible calamity. The police, and district administration was alert. It could have gone very wrong had this event taken place,” said Mr. Deshmukh."
919,Maharashtra,"April 03, 2020 01:47 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,Fisherfolk to get separate landing point at Karanja jetty,"The State Fisheries Department is working to set up a separate landing point at the busy Karanja jetty in Uran for unloading the day’s catch of fish, keeping in mind the social distancing norms that are to be mandatorily followed as per State guidelines.The decision, officials said, was taken in the wake of crowding at the jetty a few days ago, giving rise to fears of infection.The Maharashtra Fisheries Department, through a public notice released on March 26, declared fish as an essential commodity to facilitate its supply and export, and ease the burden on fishermen. However, local fishermen have still been facing inconvenience due to the abruptness of the lockdown announced across the country.To save fishermen from facing extreme losses, the Vasai Fishermen’s Cooperative Society offered to purchase their stock and created an hourly token system in their office building so that social distancing could be practised and fish could be sold to local consumers.“The problem was of crowds. We had volunteers to ensure that a minimum distance was maintained and had given hourly time slots to facilitate the sale of the fish,” said Sanjay Koli, chairman of the society.However, a bigger problem was observed at Karanja and Sassoon docks, where the fishermen complained of excess fish having to go to waste due to the lack of cold storage facilities, stoppage of auctioning in wholesale markets and absence of exporters willing to purchase stocks at the usual price. Rajendra Jadhav, Joint Commissioner of Fisheries, Maharashtra said, four days ago, the massive crowds that gathered near the Karanja jetty for auctioning were deemed a hazard considering the spread of the coronavirus, because of which the gram panchayat and co-operative society together took a decision to shut down the wholesale market. “At Karanja, there was such a large crowd four days ago that a decision had to be taken to close the jetty where the fish were auctioned after being caught. We are now working to develop a separate spot for landing in Karanja, as well as storage, but this is still in process,” he said.Amol Roge, chairman of the Martanda Prasanna Colaba Matsyodyog, a society working for welfare of fishermen in Colaba, said about 60% of his catch at Sassoon Dock will have to be disposed of, 10% was sold to local residents upon arrival of the boats while 25-30% was picked up by middlemen or suppliers.“These middlemen who supply to the company did not inform us of the rates or weights of the stock. They said they will let us know as soon as they hear from the companies that they were buying for. It has been seven to eight days since they took our fish but I haven’t heard from them,” said Mr. Roge.For every trip he makes, Mr. Roge has to spend around ₹3 lakh on diesel and wages of 16 to 17 crew members on each boat.He said distribution of fish to local residents is becoming difficult as it leads to crowding, which in turn invites a police crackdown.In Palghar district, trucks of exporter companies are being allowed to carry fish to Porbandar in Gujarat, where they can be preserved in cold storage for about two months. “However, this facility is not accessible for local fishermen from villages spread across the vast coastline of India,” said Ganesh Nakhawa, a fisherman from Karanja. Mr. Nakhawa said it is also easier for the ports in the North, which have better connectivity to Gujarat. Asked whether measures such as construction of landing sites or provision of cold storage would be available for docks such as Sassoon, Mr. Jadhav said, “I don't have information from my staff, of crowds gathering or problems with sales there. Measures are only being taken at Karanja as of now.”"

With the city shutting down on account of the Janata Curfew, she, along with over 40 families who live on the pavement, were left scrounging for food and water. “We have been cooking and eating whatever we have. Stocks from the local ration shop were over long ago and vegetable prices have hit the roof,” said Mr. Shaikh.With the city in lockdown, homeless citizens have been left in the lurch, and city activists have urged the State government to take quick action to mitigate a threat to their survival.Brijesh Arya, convener of the Homeless Collective, said the community mostly survives on daily wages. “When Mumbai is in a lockdown situation, local shops are closing one by one, street food shops will be shut and the homeless will suffer unimaginably,” he said.The situation, he said, was getting dire as activists could not reach them with supplies of food and water due to the lockdown.Sitaram Shelar of the Pani Haq Samiti, said the lack of water was among the key issues they were faced with at this hour. “They are among the most vulnerable population in the city and the majority don’t have access to the public distribution system. It is imperative that the government do something for them immediately,” he said.According to the 2011 census, there were 57,415 homeless people in Mumbai. Mr. Shelar said that some estimates peg it at close to a lakh. “The ones living alone who could leave the city have gone, but nearly 75% of the homeless live here with their families. Where will they go?” Mr. Arya said. The government, he said, should look at temporarily shifting the homeless into empty municipal buildings or schools, where basic provisions such as electricity, safe drinking water and sanitation are available.Mr. Shaikh said that with the lockdown in place, many were also worried about their jobs and whether they will even be paid for the days they have worked so far. “We don’t know what the future holds for us. Some of us continue to work in people’s homes, but we don’t know how long that will last,” he said."

927,Maharashtra,"March 26, 2020 01:10 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,Power demand crashes in State,"The economic impact of the novel coronavirus is starting to be felt in the State, which is witnessing a sharp drop in energy demand as a result of the continuing industrial and commercial shutdown. The total daily demand has fallen by 20% to 17,850 megawatts (MW) from the record high of 21,000 MW, more than a month ago on February 21. Not only is the revenue of the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited (MSEDCL) likely to dip but also the financial situation will worsen since most of the shut industries are cross-subsidising individual and households. Supply likely to dipThe supply is also likely to dip since the transportation of coal is getting affected due to the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of the virus, senior officials said.In a meeting on Wednesday, the State government issued directives to impose a moratorium on penalties and interests on bills pending this month. The 31-day lockdown period — seven declared by the State and 21 by the Centre — will not be taken into account while calculating penalties. The payment for consumption in the period can also be submitted on a later date. An official said, “The Chief Minister has clarified, we [consumers and the government] are in this together. Until the crisis is over, we will not even take meter readings for individuals and households, instead they would be allowed to take a reading and submit it to us. We are sure there will not be a fraud in this. We trust our consumers during this period. No power connections will be cut on account of rule violations and non-payment of bills.” The government said since the supply could also be impacted, as has happened on the national level with India’s power supply crashing to 29,750 lakh units (LU) from 35,650 LU, a proposal would be sent to procure power from private players. The government is looking at buying 250 MW of other forms of electricity, like solar, from private companies willing to sell. “This is a serious economic threat to MSEDCL which is already under lot of financial stress. Next three months are crucial from the economic point of view,” an official said."

The market was closed for two days, which was beginning to impact supply of vegetables, leading to rise in prices. “We have opened Dadar and Byculla market from Wednesday and Navi Mumbai APMC would be working from Thursday. There will not be any shortage of supply in any part of Mumbai or suburbs,” said Mr. Bhujbal. He also spoke to the police commissioners of Mumbai and Nashik to ensure the police don’t stop vehicles carrying essential commodities and empty vehicles while returning.However, APMC authorities said on Wednesday operations would resume only on Saturday, in a phased manner. The decision was taken after two days of meetings between APMC authorities, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC), Konkan division officials, the police and the regional transport office. Priority will be given to vegetable and cereals, following which the other markets, including masala, fruits, and onion and potato, will resume. The plan is to get 30% to 40 % of the market functioning in the first phase.NCP leader Shashikant Shinde, the secretary of the mathadi workers’ union, said, “The market committee has decided to take full precautions, provide masks and sanitisers to each person. To reduce the crowd in the market, we are planning to provide the vegetables directly to retailers.” NMMC Commissioner Annasaheb Misal said the civic body has instructed the APMC board to find ways to let retailers order stock online or on phone to avoid crowding.On Wednesday, the APMC board gave a demonstration to all stakeholders on the precautions that have to be practised. “Vendors, purchasers and other stakeholders were told about social distancing, personal sanitisation, thermal scanning and medical emergencies,” Konkan Divisional Commissioner Shivaji Daund said.Mr. Shinde said they had asked for a list of retailers and at least two general stores in every area where they can directly deliver the essentials. “We also plan to set up a hotline and war room to help vehicles coming from different States. Stickers will be provided to every vehicle, and identity cards will be issued to every staff and driver transporting and delivering the stock. We are short of labourers and are trying to use the manpower we have,” he said. Sanjay Pansare, secretary of the fruit market, said depending on the success of this system for vegetables, fruit sales will also be started slowly.Nilesh Veera, director of the grain market, said the board will give another safety demonstration in the market on Thursday. “The Mayor has promised to provide NMMT buses for employees and traders to reach the market. The challenge is to get the market and distribution channel working.”Isolation rooms by PWD Meanwhile, Public Works Department (PWD) Minister Ashok Chavan on Wednesday said around 22,118 rooms, which could accommodate 55,707 isolation beds, have been kept ready through his department if needed.“The PWD has hundreds of buildings in every part of the State. These include guest houses, hostels, new buildings which are yet to be given for public use. These buildings have water and electricity supply. Emergency services in many parts of the State have already started using them,” he said. Mr. Chavan said that district collectors have been authorised to make the rooms available."

According to district administration officials, their samples following the 14-day isolation period, as well as their repeat samples taken 24 hours later, tested negative. Pune Divisional Commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar said three other patients in close contact with the couple, who had tested positive the very next day (March 10), could expect discharge on Thursday if both their samples returned negative.“The first samples of the three patients in close contact with the couple have tested negative. Today, we are awaiting the results of their repeat samples. If they return negative as well, then these three people will be discharged on Thursday,” Mr. Mhaisekar said, lauding the efforts of all medical personnel in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. The couple, who were part of a 40-member tour group to Dubai, had returned to India along with their daughter on March 1. On landing at Mumbai International Airport, they had taken a cab to Pune.After the couple tested positive on March 9, their daughter, along with another co-passenger from Yavatmal, and the cab driver who ferried them, had also tested positive on March 10.Soon after their discharge on the occasion of Gudi Padwa, the couple penned a note of heartfelt thanks to doctors and staff of Naidu Hospital. “We were admitted on March 9. We adhered strictly to all rules laid down by the doctors and the hospital staff. After our repeat samples have returned negative, we are being discharged today. We are now cured and are coronavirus-free and are sure that other patients like us who have tested positive would recover very soon,” the couple wrote.While Mr. Mhaisekar expressed satisfaction at the development, he said it was a matter of grave concern that the number of positive cases in Pune division continued to rise.Maharashtra’s sugar heartland witnessed a surge in COVID-19 cases on Wednesday after five more people of a family from Islampur tehsil in Sangli district in western Maharashtra tested positive for the virus, taking the State’s tally to 122 (10 cases reported from Mumbai Metropolitan Region). “The new cases in Sangli are members of the same family with a travel history to Saudi Arabia,” he said.On Monday, four members of this family had tested positive, making them the first cases in the district. With the fresh cases, Sangli now has a total of nine positive cases.Mr. Mhaisekar further said that till now, samples of 825 people had been taken of which 737 samples had been received thus far. “Of these, 692, that is 90% of the samples, have returned negative while 37 samples in the division have tested positive.” Urging people to stay indoors and strictly follow the lockdown orders during the 21-day period as announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Mr. Mhaisekar warned that the district administration’s containment plan was in danger of derailing if people congregated needlessly at vegetable markets or grocery stores.“It is the responsibility of every citizen to support medical staff who are striving to combat the crisis, by staying indoors and prevent the spread of infection. I request all to not violate the 21-day lockdown. No essential supply, be it medicines, foodgrains or vegetables, will be hit even if there may be supply snags for a while,” he said.He further warned that if any officer neglected his duty in tackling this crisis, then they would face stern action.Hitherto untouched by the scourge of the virus, Sangli and Satara districts have witnessed a spurt in positive cases in the last 72 hours.On Tuesday, the Sangli district police had lodged a complaint against a father-son duo hailing from Nepal and living in Miraj tehsil from violating home quarantine orders.According to authorities, the family of four, which had settled at Karnal in Miraj for some years, used to eke out a living by doing menial tasks and freelancing as labourers. Earlier this month, the father and the son had returned from Nepal and had been kept under strict quarantine, which they violated.On Monday this week, Maharashtra's sugar-belt districts had recorded its first positive cases after a 45-year-old woman from Satara with a travel history to Dubai tested positive.

To avoid long queues or crowds at branches, banks have also been encouraging customers to use netbanking for transactions.Mumbai Cyber police officials said that over the last couple of weeks, they have observed an increase in phishing calls where fraudsters call their targets posing as bank executives.“Instead of the usual spiel about updating know your customer (KYC) details or the accounts being frozen for whatever reasons, this time the fraudsters are using the loan moratorium as their gambit. They are now convincing their targets to reveal details like netbanking PINs to supposedly speed up the process,” a cyber crime officer said.The officer said the other modus operandi is to convince the targets to download screen-sharing apps to their cell phones and grant access to fraudsters. Once the fraudsters can see the screens while the targets are logging into their netbanking accounts, stealing the PIN and hacking the account is child’s play.An advisory issued on Monday by the Mumbai Cyber police warned people against installing screensharing apps like AnyDesk, QuickSupport, Airdroid and TeamViewer.“Any request for sensitive details like the PIN should by itself be a red flag, as no banking executive is allowed to ask for such information. Nor will the banks want their customers to install any apps other than the bank’s official app,” the officer said.Banks, too, have been sending similar advisories by email and SMS to customers, cautioning them against falling prey to such scams."

Hospitals are now taking several measures to ensure that routine medical encounters don’t lead to crippling of the health system.“We are going by the universal precaution measures. This means that any patient, symptomatic or asymptomatic, may have COVID-19 and has to be handled accordingly,” said KEM’s dean Dr. Hemant Deskmukh, adding that the doctors triage at the entry level and then direct patients to the relevant part of the hospital.Last week, a 40-year-old woman who was rushed to KEM hospital’s emergency department succumbed and later tested positive for the virus. This led to nearly 10 hospital staff, including doctors, being quarantined at home. The hospital authorities hope that universal precaution measures will help reduce such exposures.Tata Memorial Hospital (TMH), the country’s premier cancer institute, has also appointed a triage nurse and a doctor at the entrance to screen patients and separate them to an isolation room if they suspect a possibility of the infection. “First and foremost, we make sure if the patient has to be in the hospital at all. There are many who don’t see their files for appointments,” said Dr. Shripad Banavali, TMH’s academic director. He said the patient’s temperature is recorded and medical and travel history is also probed. “If there are any symptoms or suspicions of COVID-19, we immediately admit them to an isolation ward,” he said. The hospital has so far sent 30 swabs of suspected patients for testing, and all were negative.Bandra’s Lilavati Hospital has also started screening patients at the entrance. Dr. Jalil Parkar, department of chest medicine, said all this is easier said than done. “Healthcare professionals have to constantly work with this risk. However, some measures can go a long way in protecting them,” he said. Dr. Parkar said the hospital has appointed doctors to take a complete history of patients at the entry point. “This includes their medical and travel history, and also if they are coming from any of the containment zones. Triage has thus become crucial now,” he said."

She called Mr. Wadhwani, who was on a business trip in Ghana, and contacted the Kasturba Hospital to enquire about getting tested.“My wife did not get proper guidance from the hospital at first, especially considering the fact that my daughter suffers from RETT syndrome, a neuro-development disorder. The hospital refused to test my wife and she had to go to the local physician, who put her on antibiotics. When there was no change, the physician simply changed the medication,” Mr. Wadhwani said.When she called Kasturba Hospital again, the staff allegedly told her that she was ineligible for tests as she did not have ‘high fever’ and ‘dry cough’, which was among their criteria. Finally, on Mach 27, Ms. Wadhwani went to a private laboratory, where she tested positive for COVID-19.“No ambulance was ready to take her to the hospital as she had tested positive. It was only with the help of the RCF police that an ambulance was arranged to take her to Fortis Hospital in Mulund. On March 28, the rest of the family was tested, and my son as well as mother-in-law both tested positive. All three are admitted to Fortis, my wife being in the intensive care unit,” Mr. Wadhwani said. He added that his worry is compounded by the fact that his daughter, who needs special care, is now with his mother and nephew, who are not trained in taking care of her. Due to her condition, she is unable to talk, walk or eat on her own, and cannot convey to people around her when she needs to use the washroom.Since then, Mr. Wadhwani and his brother-in-law Arjun Shahani, who is in India, have contacted every possible agency, including the Ministry of External Affairs, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Indian High Commission at Accra in Ghana. “The ball, however, just keeps being tossed from one court to another,” Mr. Shahani said.Having exhausted all options, the family has started an online signature petition, while also writing to the Prime Minister’s Office.The letter has only received an acknowledgement and an application number from the PM’s online grievance redressal portal.“It is surprising that we are not getting any response. We can only hope that the Prime Minister takes some action,” Mr. Shahani said."

They shd report to nearest police, get tested & quarantined @ the earliest. Failure to do so will invite strictest police action. #WarOnCorona #NoConpromiseOnSafetyEver.” On April 2, the police, based on a complaint from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation, charged the 150 with disobeying an order promulgated by a public servant and negligent conduct likely to spread infection of a disease dangerous to life under the Indian Penal Code.“We have named 10 people in the FIR, whose attendance at the Markaz event we have confirmed so far, along with 140 other suspects. The total number of suspects is based on the number of possible attendees we had ascertained, which was in turn based on inputs shared with us by the Centre,” an officer with the Mumbai Police said. The Hindu had on April 2 reported how the police were using a cumbersome method called dump data analysis to identify and apprehend the attendees.Investigating officers said the attendance of a large number of the suspects remained to be confirmed, and several of them were untraceable, with their phones switched off. “In the case of several of them, we are still ascertaining whether they are actually based in Mumbai or passed through the city before proceeding to another location.

Inquiries are also being made at a variety of levels, including police station staff across the city and special branch officers,” another officer said. On Sunday, the Mumbai Police also tweeted asking all attendees to come forward and identify themselves.Officers said the main offence was two-fold: that the suspects attended the event despite advisories by the State government cautioning people against travelling to other States and that they did not inform the authorities once cases of the disease started getting confirmed among the attendees, putting others around them at risk.The gathering at Alami Markaz Banglewali Mosque in March is being said to be among the biggest wellsprings of the novel coronavirus.

942,Maharashtra,"April 08, 2020 01:08 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,COVID-19 | Youngsters step up to make face shields,"The novel coronavirus outbreak has opened a new market for face shields as protective gear for doctors, policemen, and other frontline workers and a bunch of 20-year-olds from Mumbai has taken the lead in designing and manufacturing them. The youngsters have donated thousands of shields over the past 10 days and have ramped up production to meet the demands coming from hospitals across the State as well as other parts of the country.Arjun Panchal (25) and his brother Parth (27) of Boson Machines, a city-based 3D printing company, have donated 10,000 face shields over the past week to various public hospitals, including Kasturba Hospital, which is city’s nodal isolation facility for COVID-19 patients. “We started with making 800 pieces a day and have already scaled up to 8,000 pieces daily,” Arjun said, adding Dr. Swapneil Parikh from Jaslok Hospital helped them modify their face shield design. Due to the labour shortage caused by the lockdown, the brothers started manufacturing in Goregaon with the help of their family members and have amplified the production to cater to demands. “We are getting funds through crowdsourcing,” Arjun said. They are able to make one piece at ₹80 and are working to bring the cost further down. “We are not looking at selling the face shields as of now.” Firoza Kothari (27), founder of Anatomiz3D, a 3D printing and rapid prototyping company, has donated 1,000 face shields to four police stations — Dadar, Oshiwara, Vakola and Vile Parle — and is already dabbling with purchase orders from private hospitals and the police department. The company has priced its face shield in the range of ₹180-₹300. “We were looking at avenues to contribute during the outbreak and realised that there was a growing demand for face shields. The 3D printing community has been very open and there are quite a few open-source designs available,” she said.Ms. Kothari said they had taken references from available designs and created a model which was most comfortable for the use of frontline workers. “Our prototype has been validated by doctors,” she said. Anatomiz3D has manufactured 18,000 pieces in the last one week.Another city-based 3D printing company, Tesseract, has produced 10,000 face shields over the past week and are now making 10,000 pieces a day. “We have demands coming from across the State and even outside. There is a huge demand from Tamil Nadu where the number of COVID-19 cases has gone up,” said the company’s co-founder, Aman Modi (26). While their model is priced at ₹100, they are working to bring the price down to ₹65 to ₹70 by next week. “The outbreak got us thinking about a quick fix solution. That’s when the idea of making face shields came up,” he said, adding they were using acrylonitrile butadiene styrene, a common thermoplastic polymer for the headband mould, and 0.4 mm polyvinyl chloride plastic polymer for the transparent sheet.Wearing personal protective equipment can get cumbersome for frontline workers but it plays a crucial role in such a health emergency. “Face shields have been commonly used in the West. It definitely offers extra protection,” Dr. Jalil Parkar from Lilavati Hospital said.Face shields are physical barriers meant to protect the facial area from splashes and spatter of body fluids. However, they cannot be used alone and are worn over the face masks for additional protection. Face shields are thus known as adjunctive personal protective equipment. On Tuesday, BMC commissioner Praveen Pardeshi was also seen wearing a face shield while surveying the containment zones in Worli and Dharavi."

In a release, the DST said Fastsense Diagnostics has proposed a technology named ‘CovE-Sens’ specifically to combat the new coronavirus, along the lines of their existing universal platform called ‘Omni-Sens’.The company plans to roll out two products, a modified polymerase chain reaction-based detection kit for confirmatory analysis in less time as compared to existing detection methods, and a portable chip-based module for rapid screening of the target population based on chip sensing technology that would provide results in less than 15 minutes per sample.The two proposed modules can be deployed at public spaces and potential virus hotspots like airports, densely populated areas and hospitals where screening can be done to prevent spread to healthy individuals, and data can be generated in less than an hour.“We are still in the prototype development process stage. Our team, comprising experts in the fields of virology, molecular biology and bioinstrumentation, are trying to deliver the prototype within the next eight to 10 weeks. With this rapid diagnostic kit, we are aiming to test approximately 50 samples in an hour,” said Dr. Preeti Nigam Joshi, founding director, Fastsense Diagnostics. The sample size for confirmatory tests could be increased to 100 samples per hour in the future, she said.Once the prototype is completed, validation would be sought from the Pune-based National Institute of Virology, besides approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research.The portable rapid diagnostics kit would also prevent future relapse by regular monitoring while the low cost and ease of operation would ensure a wide reach, especially to the rural populace. This would prevent overloading of the strained urban health infrastructure, Dr. Nigam Joshi said.“The major challenges of testing for COVID-19 are speed, cost, accuracy and accessibility at the point of care or use. Several start-ups have developed rather creative and innovative ways to address these needs. DST is supporting the most promising of these to facilitate their development-to-commercialisation chain if found suitable on technical grounds,” said Professor Ashutosh Sharma, Secretary, DST, in a statement."

Soon after the announcement of the national lockdown, he was asked to stay indoors.The youth was left with only ₹3000 at that time.He heard rumours that the industry would remain closed for another three months. Mahesh would require at least ₹6000 per month for his accommodation and food. After remaining idle for a week, he realized that the lockdown was not likely to end soon while his resources were fast depleting. He could not stretch his stay at Sangli further. The lockdown had impacted everyoneand nobody would lend money, he said.“I decided to cycle back to my house at Badasuari village in Jajpur. It was a matter of survival. On April 1, I set out for Odisha. Though I did not have a map, I remembered the names of major railway stations from my previous train journeys,” said the youth.Some fellow villagers, who were still stranded in Sangli, had warned Mr. Mahesh against cycling such a long distance. Mr. Mahesh used to cycle 12 km daily, to get to his workplace and to a hotel for food. He would begin cycling before dawn and continue till lunch time. Few roadside dhabas were open for truck drivers carrying essential goods. He would spend two to three hours eating, resting and taking a quick nap before getting back up again on his cycle seat. “I was averaging close to 200-km per day,” recounted Mr. Mahesh.Some benevolent truck drivers would offer to take him with them fro a certain distance when he narrated his ordeal to them. But they would hold back the next moment, saying they would be risking cancellation of permits if found carrying someone. Mr. Mahesh cycled along the Solapur-Hyderabad-Vijayawada-Visakhapatnam-Srikakulam route before entering Odisha through Ganjam district.“Heat exhaustion was taking a toll on me, but I did not get distracted. I was determined to reach home. During the night, I would look for safe places like temples, schools and roadside dhabas to halt,” he narrated.At the Maharashtra border, when the police questioned him about his journey, he convinced them by describing his amazing bicycle-ride. He would cycle for almost 16 hours a day. Four days after he started his journey, he called his family members with a mobile phone, borrowed from a stranger. His family was very concerned and advised him to take precautions.Mr. Mahesh reached Jajpur district by late evening on April 7. However, his family members said villagers were reluctant to allow him inside the village without a check-up at a hospital. They informed the Jajpur district administration which then sent him to a quarantine centre at Upendra Kumar High School at Bichitrapur. “The seven-day arduous journey was more comfortable than the boredom at the isolation centre,” said Mr. Mahesh."

Sunday is the market’s official holiday. “We have received around 500 trucks of grains and will stop all the trading operations from Monday. The grains stock will remain stocked up,” said market director Nilesh Veera.The grains market on an average gets 300 trucks daily. Since last two days, the number of incoming and outgoing trucks have been close to 500 due to a backlog.

The police intervened and got the matter solved, following which the market started operations. The decision to shut the market was taken keeping the number of increasing cases of the virus in Mumbai.“Only 30% mathadi workers were working till now and all were scared for their life. Though there was screening and limitations on the people entering the market, it was risky,” mathadi leader Narendra Patil said. Panic increased after a Mumbai resident, who is a trader at the masala market, tested positive.Meanwhile, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has launched Navi Mumbai Bazzar, an app for people to purchase essentials and also avail pathology service.

The recent discovery of widespread infection among attendees of the Tablighi Jamaat’s gathering in New Delhi has fanned the fire, with communally charged posts now surfacing with worrying frequency.According to Cyber police officers, 172 cases have been registered against instances of fake news, rumour-mongering and hate speech over social media in the State since the start of the lockdown. Twelve cases were registered in the last 24 hours.‘A rising trend’Superintendent of police Balsing Rajput, Maharashtra Cyber, said, “There is a rising trend in cases of hate speech over the last seven days, with 87 cases being registered in this regard. The other major category is of fake news or rumours with 61 cases being registered, and 24 cases of other kinds of misinformation have also been recorded.”Mr. Rajput said of the total cases, 166 are First Information Reports, while six are non-cognisable cases. The police have so far arrested 32 people and identified 108 others who are being traced. The most number of cases were observed on WhatsApp, with Facebook, TikTok and Twitter following close behind.

There are 55 posts on other mediums and we have issued notices to them. The process of removal is in progress,” he said. Mr. Rajput said every effort is being made to reach out to citizens and impress upon them the importance of not forwarding or posting unverified information on social media, particularly WhatsApp, as it is difficult to stem the flow once a post starts circulating on the popular messaging app. The police have already issued advisories at the State and city level, warning against rumour- or hate-mongering on WhatsApp. The police have warned administrators of WhatsApp groups that they will be held as responsible as the members concerned if such instances are observed."

The first drive-through sample collection site was launched in Gurgaon’s Sector 29 on April 11.The facility will collect the test sample without people having to step out of their cars. The patient remains in the passenger seat, next to the driver, or in the left rear seat. Nasal or throat swab sample is taken through the car window, and the entire process (drive-in entry to exit) takes five to 10 minutes.The swab is sent to a laboratory for testing and the patient can receive the report the same day if the sample is given before noon.“Sites like these are needed greatly as active cases in Mumbai are increasing exponentially and the drive-through concept works as a great tool to fast-track sample collection. Not only is the method faster, but also limits human interaction with potentially infected people, preventing the spread of the virus,” said Ravi Aggarwal, regional COO (south, west, central India and international business), SRL Diagnostics.Mr. Aggarwal said the method originated in South Korea and is becoming popular all over the world. “The idea behind drive-through testing is simple: keeping potentially sick patients in their cars and allowing plenty of ventilation throughout the testing facility,” he said.SRL Diagnostics has set up a toll-free number (1800-222-000) for making the drive-through test appointment. The documents required for the testing are a form filled by a qualified physician, doctor’s prescription seeking a test and Aadhaar card.On calling the toll-free number, the patient will be asked to share their e-mail address on which all the required forms will be shared. Alternatively, the patient can download the forms from the SRL website. In case any patient does not have an e-mail address, WhatsApp is used to send and receive all the documents. The drive-through testing facility is available from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. on all days.Dr. Prabal Deb, director, lab operations and chief histopathologist, clinical reference lab, Mumbai, SRL Diagnostics, said, there was a huge shortage of personal protective equipment like masks, gloves, hazmat suits and so on, and thus the need to find innovative ways to conduct tests efficiently. “By collecting samples through these drive-throughs, we are not compromising on the testing protocols and simultaneously doing everything we can to protect the well-being of our brave and selfless frontline soldiers by minimising human-to-human interaction,” Dr. Deb said."

Many of them say they have no option but to walk back to their villages as they are fast running out of a key commodity — kerosene.Kedar Mandal, a daily wage labourer from Jharkhand who lives with three others in Nagapada, said they have managed to survive over the last three weeks though securing rations has been a challenge. He said, “We ran out of kerosene three days ago and we’re cooking food using wood. Even that is hard to come by these days,” Mr. Mandal said they had to buy kerosene from the black market as they do not have ration cards. “The prices have soared to nearly ₹100 per litre, when it is available. Many places no longer have stocks,” he said.Gopal Das, a daily wage construction worker from Bihar, said even ration shops have stopped supplying kerosene. Mr. Das said, “Many who have stocks of grain are now at the mercy of food distribution trucks for even basic meals for which there is always a very long queue.” ‘Ready to leave’He said most workers in Kherwadi, where he lives, were ready to leave once the nationwide lockdown was supposed to end on Tuesday. “People just want to go home. If they had started train services, people would have gradually left over 10 to 12 days,” he said.Meanwhile, organisations working on the ground to provide essentials to the needy and vulnerable have said they are not able to provide supplies of the fuel. “We can organise rations, but we don’t have mechanisms to procure kerosene, which is essential for survival,” said Bilal Khan of Ghar Bachao Ghar Banao Andolan. Mr. Khan has been among those attending to distress calls and distributing rations over the last two weeks He said Ujjwala Yojana barely covers 50% of women who were eligible under the scheme in the city.

Byculla’s Saboo Siddiqui Hospital and Dadar’s Shushrusha Hospital, which offer dialysis, had to be shut down after patients tested positive and infected staffers. Millat Nagar Hospital in Jogeshwari had to stop operations after two patients registered for dialysis tested positive. The hospital was disinfected and re-opened.The BMC had earlier issued a circular directing dialysis centres to screen all patients for COVID-19 symptoms. Centres can create a separate dialysis facility for positive patients. Any centre violating these directions can face punitive action. COVID-19 patients can also be referred to Kasturba, KEM, Saifee, SevenHills and Nanavati hospitals for dialysis. The BMC has now decided to expand mandatory testing to cancer patients requiring chemotherapy and pregnant women requiring a C-section.Municipal Commissioner Praveen Pardeshi said, “Doctors had stopped taking these patients. The management of Tata Hospital said their staff is getting infected. That is why we took this decision. [These patients] will be tested even if they have no symptoms. All of these people are now being proactively pre-tested. Besides, for COVID-19 cases we have set aside separate dialysis machines.”However, there are fears these patients will lose valuable time as reports take at least four days. Besides, dialysis and chemotherapy are treatments that are repeated regularly."
975,Maharashtra,"April 15, 2020 01:29 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,Fundraiser launched to support male sex workers,"Purohit (name changed) is a queer man from Kolkata who recently moved to Bengaluru for better employment opportunities. Then the novel coronavirus spread and a lockdown was announced. With meagre savings and rent looming over his head, the young man has had to resort to sex work, which is hard to execute in light of social distancing. “Male sex workers are unorganised in the country, with most NGOs working for trans and female sex workers,” says Esthappen S., a 29-year-old queer playwright who has spearheaded a campaign to help this largely neglected section of society. Hosted on Milaap, the new fundraising campaign uses platforms like Tinder and Grindr, where male-identifying queer individuals practise sex work. The anonymity associated with these web-based apps makes it easier for queer male sex workers to reach out for help.How it startedIt all started when 31-year-old Sadam Hanjabam, a queer activist and scholar, noticed several profiles on the apps asking for help. Hanjabam is the founder and CEO of YA_ALL, a youth-queer led network in Manipur and other Northeastern States, which works at the grassroots level. Hanjabam contacted Esthappen and the two decided to organise a fundraiser to help queer sex workers. Since the apps are platforms for male-identifying individuals, their primary target is that section of the community, but the duo is also offering help to anyone approaching them. “We get messages asking about the severity of the need of the people we’re giving money to, they ask ‘how do you know they’re not using it for cigarettes,’” says Esthappen. “But we have no judgement and this is just a little support available to those who need it.” Each individual seeking financial aid will receive ₹1,000 at first. After a few essential enquiries such as location and surface-level background questions, the money is transferred online. As of now, the duo is working in Delhi, Bengaluru, Manipur and Mumbai and hope to expand the efforts when donations grow.Difficult to seek helpThe male sex working community is largely fractured because of its unorganised nature. There is shame attached to the medium of work within the queer community itself, making it even more difficult to seek help. The individuals, mostly migrants from different parts of the country, sometimes supplement their day jobs with sex work, almost never making an identity out of the occupation. The age group, while heavily skewed between 20 and 24 years, also ranges above 60. While there are several non-profits working to help everyone in need, Esthappen says there needs to be efforts to include all sections of society because people feel “there is so much shame in asking for help in these times”.To donate, visit milaap.org/fundraisers/support-esthappen"

They don’t want food or shelter, they want to go back home,” Mr. Thackeray said.After train services were stopped, the State had requested they be allowed to run for 24 hours more so that migrants could go back home, he said. “CM Uddhav Thackeray raised this issue in the PM-CM video conference as well, requesting a roadmap for migrant labour to reach home,” tweeted the minister.A mutual road map set by the Union government will largely help migrant labour to reach home from one State to another safely and efficiently, he said. “Time and again, this issue has been raised with the Centre. The law and order situation in Surat has largely been seen as a similar situation and … the feedback from all migrant labour camps is similar. Many are refusing to eat or stay there. Currently, more than 6 lakh people are housed in various shelter camps across Maharashtra,” he said.Later in the evening, Mr. Thackeray said the Centre had taken immediate cognisance of the issue. “We understand the Catch-22 situation the Centre and States face. I’m thankful to the PM and HM for understanding the situation, while trying to ensure the safety of home States of migrants,” he said on Twitter.BJP attackThe Bharatiya Janata Party, meanwhile, said the Bandra incident was a result of the State’s inability to provide food and shelter to migrant labourers. “We have been saying this to the State government for many days, but they refused to listen. We hope the government learns a lesson from today’s incident,” said Leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis. He said it was unfortunate the Central government was being blamed for the incident.News clip under scannerMeanwhile, Yuva Sena leader Varun Sardesai tweeted a video clip from a Marathi news channel which talked about the Centre starting special trains for migrant workers. Mr. Sardesai alleged that the clip resulted in the rumour of outstation trains resuming services, and sought action against the channel.The Sena’s Rajya Sabha member Priyanka Chaturvedi also demanded action against the channel. “Their Marathi channel runs the story in the morning. Their national channel reports the chaos in the evening. Chronology samajhiye (understand the chronology),” she said in a tweet.The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress, too, hit out at the news channel for airing a misleading story, accusing it of creating chaos at Bandra. Minority Affairs Minister and NCP’s chief spokesperson Nawab Malik tweeted the news clip and said the possibility of a crowd gathering at Bandra after this news was broadcast cannot be denied. Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant, meanwhile, blamed the Ministry of Railways. “It is the @RailMinIndia which is completely responsible for today’s chaos. Extreme mismanagement and careless approach has been the epitome of the Modi government. How could they take bookings? Why didn’t they give information of [ticket] cancellation earlier? How could a [news] channel get this letter [on the booking]?” he tweeted, posting photos of the Railways accepting reservations from April 16."

In Bibvewadi, 70 people were booked, while action was taken against 54 in Hadapsar.With the number of cases exceeding the 400 mark and more than 45 deaths being reported from the city, the Pune Police have imposed stringent lockdown measures by sealing off nearly half the city, which includes the densely-packed Bhavani Peth, Kondhwa, Bibvewadi areas and parts of old Pune.Pune has witnessed a rapid surge in the number of COVID-19 cases, with more than 200 fresh cases being reported over a four day-period. The city has recorded more than 15 deaths in this same period.

Those living in the areas still relatively unscathed by the novel coronavirus have to factor in the reactions of their fellow society members. With the number of cases increasing in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, there is an understandable paranoia running through society committees regarding any person stepping outside and returning home after a long time,” Pavanjit Mane of the FITE’s Pune chapter said.He said even if the guidelines exempted IT employees who had children, there was the question of those who shared their flat with colleagues.“In that case, if one of them travels to work, then he or she endangers the health of their room-mates. Furthermore, if the driver of the company shuttles happen to live in a highly-infected zone, he could pose a risk as nearly half of Pune and areas of Pimpri-Chinchwad have been classed as COVID-19 sensitive zones,” Mr. Mane said.He said if someone were to contract the virus, it would pose a huge challenge to quarantine that person’s contacts given the number of shared spaces in a major IT company.“Furthermore, the fact that large IT firms have more than 10,000 employees, even if half of them were asked to report to work, it would have an impact on social distancing. As IT employees are the only workforce with the wherewithal to work from home, we request the State government, the Guardian Minister and the District Collector to reconsider the Centre’s directives regarding IT firms,” reads the letter."

Labs that violate the new rule will face action.On April 12, the BMC decided to prioritise testing to reduce the burden on its labs. However, it sparked outrage with India already under fire over its poor testing rate. On Wednesday, the BMC held a meeting to revise its policy after the city reported a drop in new COVID-19 cases and deaths, which was seen as an effect of reduced testing. Asymptomatic people will now have to be tested between the fifth and 14th day of quarantine as per norms of the Indian Council of Medical Research. The revised guidelines state: “High-risk contacts may be tested on the fifth day after careful observation. High-risk contacts with co-morbidities should be admitted as per guidelines issued for isolation/admission. If symptoms develop in quarantined asymptomatic people, they will be tested within the 14-day period.”A majority of COVID-19 patients in Mumbai are asymptomatic and those who were admitted to hospitals are being moved to quarantine facilities. Patients who live in multi-storeyed buildings and can set aside a room with an attached toilet will be allowed to be in home quarantine; others will be placed in institutional quarantine facilities.According to the new circular, healthcare workers exposed to COVID-19 patients but are asymptomatic will now be tested. If they are high-risk contacts, women pregnant up to 34 weeks, patients undergoing dialysis and chemotherapy will be tested even if they are asymptomatic. If they aren’t high-risk contasts, they will be screened before dialysis/chemotherapy /C-section.Risk of false negativeThe BMC said all asymptomatic people will be tested after the seventh day. It said, “If asymptomatic people are tested within seven days, there is a chance that the results might be ‘false negative’ when they may actually be positive. That is why, asymptomatic people will be quarantined and tested after the seventh day.” If asymptomatic high-risk contacts do not have symptoms within 14 days, they will still be tested on the 14th day as per the new norms.BMC has claimed to have the highest testing rate in the country. By April 13, the civic body had conducted 27,397 tests or 12.59% of the country’s total tests."

In a circular issued by the Housing Department on Friday, the landlords/owners have been directed to not evict tenants due to non-payment of timely rent or rent exhaustion amid the economic gloom and doom resulting from the lockdown.“Due to the lockdown, markets, businesses, factories, and overall financial transactions are closed. This has also affected the employment of the general public, and many tenants have been left without any livelihood,” additional chief secretary (housing) Sanjay Kumar said in his circular. Thousands of tenants are not able to pay regular rent because their paying capacity has exhausted, he said. “The home owners are hereby advised to postpone the lease rent for at least three months.” Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said the proposal would be implemented with immediate effect. “Maharashtra State Housing Department has issued instructions to landlords/ house owners to postpone rent collection by at least three months. During this period, no tenant should be evicted from the rented house due to non-payment of rent. #WarAgainstVirus,” he tweeted. The onset of the pandemic has already generated a heated debate, weighing in on a waiver of rent for the lessees, while arguing over the fate of landlords who depend on rental income for survival. Earlier, commercial lessees argued that they could invoke provisions of ‘force majeure’ — an event or ‘act of god’ — that absolves them of contractual obligations related to rent payment. “A lot of people are facing economic hardships as a result of the pandemic. The government has taken this step keeping in mind it will be difficult for tenants to pay rents in future,” Housing Minister Jitendra Awhad said. Housing experts welcomed the move, saying it will benefit lakhs of tenants, especially in Mumbai, where rents are sky high. It could affect landlords who depend on rental income but the number of such individuals is very low, they said. “For the time being, the government seems to have taken a view that the landlord depending on rental income is in a better position to weather the economic devastation caused by this pandemic. For the tenants, it is a welcome relief as several of them will be facing extreme hardships in the near future,” said Rajesh Prajapati, managing committee member, Maharashtra Chamber of Housing Industry."

So, we have taken this proactive step to preclude similar cases from occurring in the Pune rural region. The definition of a particular case is as given by the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005 and the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013 (Nirbhaya Act),” said Ayush Prasad, Chief Executive Officer, Pune Zilla Parishad, while speaking to The Hindu.Mr. Prasad said as there was a prohibition on selling liquor during the lockdown, there was a strong possibility of alcoholics getting restive and turning violent as a result of denial.“Along with the COVID-19 pandemic outside, there is a ‘shadow pandemic’ raging inside homes. The lockdown means that a woman cannot step out of the house to escape her abusive spouse. So, by this order, the tormentors would be transferred to an institutional quarantine facility, which could mean a town hall or a village lodge or any other facility,” the official said, observing that this would also ensure that the woman would continue to be safe at home.Coronavirus lockdown | NCW launches domestic violence helplineA vigilance committee, consisting of women from three agencies — the Women and Child Department, anganwadi workers from self-help groups (SHGs) and panchayat samitis — will visit houses in each ward of a gram panchayat. These women would conduct an anti-domestic violence campaign on the lines of the UN’s ‘Ring the bell campaign’, Mr. Prasad said.Keeping track“Whilst adhering to the lockdown regulations, their duty would be to reach out to all homes and keep a track of domestic violence in their areas. We have also provided a helpline number 18002334130 at the district level and a psychologist has been hired for counselling,” Mr. Prasad said.After a case of domestic violence is registered, members of the vigilance panel will try counselling the offending husband. If the violence or harassment does not abate even after counselling, then the husband would be dispatched to institutional quarantine. “We have tied up with rural police stations and a DSP rank officer will coordinate with the vigilance committee members,” he said.

Mr. Fadnavis said allowing printing of newspapers while prohibiting its distribution holds no meaning.Mr. Thackeray however said it was ‘unnecessary confusion’. “While we support its operations and the need to reach out to the people, we want to also ensure the highest safety from a virus that the world is still grappling with. The sale of print media newspapers, magazines and productions is allowed at stalls/ shops already established, as deemed fit by the media houses. We urge the media to refrain from home deliveries,” he said, in a statement issued on Twitter.Mr. Thackeray said that, the government wholeheartedly supports the media and looks to it for suggestions and objections. “However in times of such a pandemic, where we genuinely are in need to reduce footfalls and increase safety, most economic operations are facing tough times. “Media has withstood the test of time, truth can never be stifled. We request it’s cooperation for the same,” the Chief Minister added.Various journalist bodies and unions too registered their opposition. “The order is uncalled for especially when reports say newspapers don’t cause infection.

We are planning to request Mumbai Police Commissioner to at least grant us permission for two hours during the evening ‘iftaar’. The morning ‘sehri’ people will somehow manage,” a worried Abdul Rehman Khan told IANS.Khan is owner of the decades-old landmark restaurant, Mashaallah Cuisine, nestling under the shadow of the 250-year-old historic Minara Masjid (Tower Mosque), from where it all started.For 70-year-old Shabbir Ajmanwalla, from the adjacent Bohri Mohalla, the spectre of ‘sehri’ and ‘iftaar’ without the goodies from the roadside eateries is akin to blasphemy.“My father, in the 1920s, used to tell us many stories of the food market. Later, in the 1960s, as young boys, my friends and I would hop onto a tram for purchases to break our daylong fast,” he reminisced.In those days, trams plied in south Mumbai from Colaba to Dadar Tram Terminus (Dadar TT, as it is known even today after trams stopped in 1964), traversing through congested Pydhonie, Nagdevi Street, and Mohammed Ali Road.A rich legacyThe street food market’s history is directly entwined with that of the imposing Minara Masjid, said local Urdu scribe, Aejaz Ahmed Ansari, quoting legends handed down by forefathers.“The 24x7 Ramzan market started as tiny food stalls around this mosque and kept expanding over the centuries. But in the past six to seven decades, it acquired a cult status for the sheer variety of food, their unique preparation styles and memorable taste, attracting people from around the world,” Ansari told IANS.According to 62-year-old Karim Patel, a local businessman with a shop near the Minara Masjid, Muslims comprise barely 25 percent of the patrons, the rest comprise around 60 percent non-Muslims and foreigners or tourists.“Certain varieties of food and desserts are specially prepared or available only during Ramzan, so people make it a point to come and savour these. A few are handed down by families from generations and are truly unique,” Patel said with a smile.“The main market is spread around a kilometre on each side of the Minara Masjid, the rest is a spillover that comes up during Ramzan owing to the huge demand. The main market has around 100 plus food stalls, the spillover comprises another 400 odd sellers. It’s a celebration of national integration through food, in Ramzan,” said Khan.Teeming in a tiny corner in the congested Muslim-dominated residential-cum-commercial district, this year many non-Muslims may experience withdrawal symptoms of Mohammed Ali Road food market.From far and wideKhan said on an average, the food market — with 90 percent non-vegetarian offerings — attracts around 40,000 people daily, and during weekends, the number shoots up to 100,000, and the month averages around 1.50 million hungry customers.“On an average, a person spends between ₹ 500 to 800 for a hearty meal, so calculate the massive businesses generated here. There are thousands of families who work only in Ramzan month and survive the remaining 11 months. That’s the kind of ‘barkat’ (benevolence) here, thanks to Minara Masjid,” he said.Patel said each stall employs roughly 10 persons and for Ramzan, specialists are called from around the country to help cope with the bulk cooking requirements.“Though the theme is Mughlai cuisine, we get specialized ‘Khansamas’ (traditional master chefs) of biryanis from Lucknow, niharis from Delhi, tawa food experts from Bahraich (UP), and the like,” said Khan.The markets are thronged by commoners and celebs, diplomats, domestic and foreign tourists, and hungry hoppers who drive down from places in 200 to 300 km range like Surat, Bharuch, Nashik, Pune, Satara, Goa, for a ‘culinary wild night out’ and drive back home the next morning, said Nagori.However, most local restaurateurs confide they don’t encourage celebs as “they disturb the whole market with their brief appearance”, although many bigwigs quietly wait in their dark-tinted glass vehicles, collect their packed food without any fanfare and quietly retreat to enjoy their food elsewhere.Among the notable Ramzan regulars are Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif, Sanjay Dutt, Ayesha Takiya-Azmi, Remo D’Souza, Nawaz Siddiqui, and in the past there were Dilip Kumar, Dev Anand, Rajendra Kumar, Raj Kapoor, et al.This market’s reputation has spawned many similar ‘Ramzan markets’ in Mumbai at Mahim, Kurla, Bandra, Andheri, Jogeshwari, Mira Road, Vasai, Pune, Malegaon, Nashik, Sangli, Surat, Delhi, Hyderabad, etc, but die-hard connoisseurs swear that the ‘Mohammed Ali Road food bazaar’ beats them all."

After preliminary inquiries with the labourers, the police booked the driver, Rajan Yadav, and Obaidur Rehman Chaudhari, the truck owner’s brother, in connection with the matter. They were arrested and later released on bail. The duo have been charged with disobeying an order promulgated by a public servant and for negligent conduct with respect to an infectious disease under the Indian Penal Code, along with sections of the Disaster Management Act.Meanwhile, the labourers are being counselled and rehabilitated with the help of the Bhiwandi Nizampura Municipal Corporation and some NGOs.Known as the handloom town of the State, Bhiwandi attracts daily wage labourers by the hundreds as there are endless employment opportunities in the handloom mills and units in the town. The lockdown, and particularly its extension, has hit areas like Bhiwandi the worst, where large chunks of the population hail from outer States and depend on their daily wage for subsistence."

Even in case of e-commerce companies, the government has revised earlier guidelines. The companies can now ply with necessary permission for delivery of essential commodities, food, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment only. No sweet shops or confectioneries will be allowed to run in Mumbai and Pune. Revised guidelines, signed by Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta, said the relaxations will remain operative in other parts of the State, except MMR and PMR.The State government also reversed the decision to prohibit door-to-door delivery of newspapers in all parts of the State, except for MMR, PMR and containment zones announced by the respective district administrations. Objections to decision The decision to stop home delivery of newspapers had faced objections from various quarters, especially print journalists. Mr. Thackeray had said he would rethink after April 20. As per the revised guidelines, door-to-door delivery is allowed in all areas, except MMR, PMR and containment zones. In these areas, newspapers can be sold through shops, which are exempted under the lockdown relaxations.The government has clarified that “wherever door-to-door delivery is done, it shall be with the knowledge of receiver and the delivery personnel shall wear mask, use hand sanitiser and maintain social distancing.” On Monday, the Aurangabad Bench of the Bombay High Court had questioned the “logic” of the decision to ban door-to-door distribution, while allowing people to step out and buy them from street stalls.

995,Maharashtra,"April 22, 2020 01:52 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,Medicine travels from Nagpur to Ludhiana on special request,"To ensure timely delivery of essential medicines, the Central Railway (CR) coordinated with other zones so that a parcel from Nagpur could reach Ludhiana, despite there being no direct train between the two cities. The CR received a request from one Sukhdev Mandar, who needed a certain type of medicine to be procured from Nagpur. Mr. Mandar, who returned from Canada around four years ago, said he was taking a particular tablet, which was a cocktail of four drugs, prescribed to him by doctors in Canada, for an immunity-related ailment. “While I could not get the same drug here, I was taking two pills, each having two of the drugs in the original combination, as substitutes and procured them directly from a pharma company based in Delhi,” he said.The person he would interact with in Delhi left for Nagpur just before the lockdown was imposed and took Mr. Mandar’s medicines along in the hope of transporting them from Nagpur. “I was told that there were no direct trains from Nagpur to Ludhiana, so I created a Twitter account and put a message with my problem as I was fast running out of the medicines,” he said.A day after he put the query, the chief parcel supervisor (CPS) from Nagpur, Shekhar Balekar, called him to understand the requirement. “Initially they told me that they could only send the medicines up to New Delhi. But a day later, Mr. Balekar said they had booked my parcel till Ludhiana,” Mr. Mandar said. The medicines were booked on a train to Itarsi, where they were unloaded and the put on another train travelling from Hyderabad and to Amritsar, a day later. “While boarding my medicine, they took videos and photos of the box and gave me the box number, since the package was small. They were also in constant touch with the CPS in Itarsi and Ludhiana and had given their numbers to me as well,” Mr. Mandar said.Krishnath Patil, senior divisional commercial manager, Nagpur Division, CR, said they did not do transshipment under normal circumstances, but decided to coordinate since these were extraordinary circumstances. The medicines reached Mr. Mandar on Sunday. He said that he had only one dose remaining, for Monday, and didn’t know what he would have done if the medicines had not come on time. “Under the current circumstances, these medicines were crucial. I have only the Railways to thank for ensuring it reached me,” he said."
996,Maharashtra,"April 22, 2020 01:47 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,KEM gets 30-bed ICU for coronavirus patients,"KEM Hospital now has a 30-bed ICU facility dedicated to COVID-19 positive patients.In order to address the issue of patients of the virus dying in transit, the hospital has started a new facility where critical and suspected patients will be kept in a ward equipped with staff and ventilators.Depending on their test results, they will be moved to a 30-bed dedicated facility meant for critical patients, or another such facility meant for patients who test negative but display severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) symptoms, are critical and require isolation.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has divided facilities into COVID Care Centres (for asymptomatic cases), Dedicated COVID Health Centres for moderate COVID-19 cases and Dedicated COVID Hospitals (DCH) for severe cases.KEM Hospital is under the DCH category. Initially, it could not cater to critical patients as it did not have ICU beds purely for them, and would transfer them to Seven Hills or Kasturba. The 30-bed critical care ward has resolved that.The hospital management felt the need for separate critical care facilities for patients after the triage stage (the assignment of degrees of urgency) so that patients could be isolated in three different areas. Two wards next to the Casualty on the ground floor were vacated and revamped with the help of Tata Projects.When a serious patient comes in with breathlessness, fever, cough, he is called a COVID-19 suspect. Since his test reports would take a minimum of 12 hours, in that period, the patient will be isolated in ward 20A, which has a capacity of 15 beds.Based on the patient’s report, even if negative, the patient has to be segregated in ward 4A with a capacity of 30 beds since he or she has severe SARI. If positive, the patient will be kept in ward 4, which also has 30 beds. All three wards together have around 25 ventilators. They will have different teams that will not intermingle or interchange shifts. Teams in all three wards will get personal protective equipment.Explaining the project, Dr. Hemant Deshmukh, dean of KEM Hospital said, “The idea was that we will be able to manage any patient who comes in on ventilator or oxygen support. If a patient is serious and turns out to be positive, we cannot transfer him out. He will be kept in ward No. 4.”Of the 225 SARI patients the hospital has seen, about one-third have tested COVID-19-positive, while the rest have to be tested and kept under observation, he said. “That is why this isolation facility for those with SARI symptoms.”Ward 4, equipped with advanced equipment, was commissioned on April 20 while ward 4A was commissioned earlier.“It is a crucial addition to Mumbai. We will also ward off entry to these wards, and there will be no thoroughfare. Patients will be discharged from here only when they test negative twice,” said Dr. Deshmukh."

Trading will be done from 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. The market will be cleaned and closed by 5 p.m. “We are also using a State Transport depot nearby, where 50 trucks are allowed to enter.

998,Maharashtra,"April 22, 2020 00:49 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,State plans to put up oxygen stations near isolation beds,"A dip in oxygen saturation level in COVID-19 patients has been observed as a critical manifestation of the infection as many patients have difficulty breathing. To tackle this, the Maharashtra government plans to set up oxygen stations near every bed at health centres and dedicated hospitals treating COVID-19 patients.The civic-run Nair Hospital in Mumbai, which is being converted into a dedicated COVID-19 facility, has already started work to connect the central oxygen line to all isolation beds.An oxygen station consists of an oxygen mask docked near every bed and connected to a central oxygen supply or a smaller oxygen cylinder.Breathlessness is one of the common symptoms in COVID-19 patients. Any delay in treatment results in deterioration of the patient’s condition, eventually requiring ventilator support. “A lot of focus has been put on ventilators but the global evidence suggests that immediate access to oxygen has played a crucial role in recovery and stopping the patients from deteriorating rapidly,” said Dr. Anup Kumar Yadav, commissioner (health services), Maharashtra. Oxygen stations will be created in all level-two and -three COVID-19 facilities, he said.The State government has created a three-tier system for COVID-19 patients. COVID care centres with just a paramedic and a doctor are at the primary level for asymptomatic patients. Health centres equipped with doctors, oxygen support, an ambulance are considered level two where patients with mild symptoms and not at high risk will be admitted. Dedicated COVID-19 hospitals with specialists, intensive care units and all tertiary care facilities are at level three.Medical experts say hypoxaemia or critically low oxygen level in the blood has been seen in many COVID-19 patients, which eventually leads to damage to critical organs and becomes life-threatening.According to Dr. Jalil Parkar from the department of chest medicine in Lilavati Hospital, the normal arterial blood oxygen levels are 100%. “We start patients on some kind of oxygen therapy if it comes down to 90%,” said Dr. Parkar.Many COVID-19 patients gasp, and some of them already have conditions like asthma, which further compromises their breathing. “In such cases, when we put the patients on nasal oxygen, it helps in controlling their breathing. This is also helpful when there is a high volume of patients in the intensive care unit,” he said.Every major hospital has oxygen stations by the bedside, even outside the ICU. While some have oxygen masks, some have nasal tubes to deliver the oxygen to patients.Dr. Parkar said the government’s decision to set up oxygen stations is a step in the right direction. Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said he has been in touch with medical oxygen suppliers to ensure that there is no hindrance in supply."

Her last rites were performed the same night.Sayed Arshi, a resident of Bhendi Bazaar with a history of heart ailments, was moved between JJ Hospital and Nair hospital before being taken to KEM Hospital, where she breathed her last within five hours of admission. The family did not take her to a private hospital as many private hospitals in south Mumbai have been shut owing to employees contracting COVID-19.Sayed Aejaz, her younger brother, said, “She started experiencing extreme weakness on Wednesday. Her pulse rate was high and she could not speak. I got a call from her house and we took her in our car to JJ Hospital, where the security guard said the hospital was shut.” They then rushed her to Nair hospital, which is now treating only COVID-19 patients. When doctors refused to admit her, the family finally took her to KEM Hospital.‘Poor service’Mr. Aejaz said, “When we reached KEM, there was only one doctor. We found a stretcher and took her to the casualty ward. We waited there for 30 minutes, but she didn’t get even basic treatment. After multiple requests, a trainee doctor gave her an injection.” He said they then took her to the emergency ward but no one attended to her. “My sister’s husband placed an oxygen mask on her face as nobody was treating her.

Many claim they are forced to look for cooked meals being distributed across the city.“The situation of drivers is worsening every day and despite the assertions made by the two companies, the aid on the ground is barely noticeable,” said Shaik Salauddin, national general secretary, Indian Federation of App Based Transport Workers (IFAT). Mr. Salauddin said both companies had provided aid but in very different ways; neither did they fulfil the drivers’ needs nor was the coverage broad enough to reach everyone, he said.Uber has only paid ₹3,000 to each driver, without expectation of return, unlike Ola, he said. “They [Ola] are providing ₹500 or ₹750, or in some cases, ₹1,200 on a weekly basis to a select few. We are yet to understand the selection criteria. What’s worse is that they will need to pay this money back and it’s not even a straightforward aid to the drivers in need,” he said. Mr. Salauddin said the companies should provide an interest-free loan of ₹21,000 to help drivers tide over this distressing time.Prashant Sawardekar from IFAT said they had received cases of drivers who had been removed by both companies from the platform during the lockdown. “Ola is also distributing rations, but barely 5% of drivers we know in Mumbai have got them,” he said. “Even this ₹500 is too little as many don’t have ration cards and often have to buy LPG or kerosene in the black market.

Since the start of the lockdown, several people have been penalised for being present at religious gatherings.Police officers said they are preparing to ensure that Ramadan festivities are held without the risk of the virus spreading and penal action being taken against the faithful. Officers said the minority community has been under fire ever since the Nizamuddin Markaz and local religious leaders have been working with the police for the last one month.Mumbai Police spokesperson DCP Pranaya Ashok said, “We will be using drone cameras to keep watch over the city to ensure that mass gatherings are not held in mosques or on rooftops this year. We are using drones with loudspeakers as public address devices to make repeated appeals to the people to not violate any rules and observe the holy month while staying within the framework of the law.” Drone cameras are traditionally used to keep a watch on dense crowds during festivals like Ganeshotsav, when the number of footfalls at popular locations outnumber the police personnel. Drone speakers were first used when hundreds of supporters of Nationalist Congress Party president Sharad Pawar had gathered outside the office of the Enforcement Directorate in September last year to protest Mr. Pawar being named as an accused in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank Scam. The drone speaker was used to issue periodic warnings to the protesters, reminding them to not create a law and order problem.Additionally, police officers, with the help of local religious leaders and NGOs, have also been working to ensure that food that is traditionally used while breaking the fast twice a day — sehri in the morning and iftaari in the evening — is provided to people at their homes.An officer said, “This is being carried out by the local personnel to eliminate the need for people to step out of their houses. Appeals are being made through WhatsApp groups asking people to break the fasts inside their houses instead of doing so together in a common gathering space, as is the tradition every year. We have been circulating messages through mohalla committees and local activists for over two weeks.” Several senior officers, including Mr. Ashok and DCP (Zone I) Sangramsinh Nishandar, said there was no truth in a message being circulated that the lockdown is going to be relaxed from 3.30 a.m. to 12 noon every day during Ramadan. The Cyber police have started investigations to identify and apprehend those behind the hoax message. “According to our inquiries so far, the video is four to five days old.

Abhay Yawalkar, Director Disaster Management, government of Maharashtra, wrote to the authorities in Rajasthan requesting them to inform institutes in Kota about the scheduled transport of students and their parents. He will also speak to Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh governments, as buses carrying students will be travelling through these two States. Students and parents will be kept in 14 days of quarantine on their return and there will be a complete medical check-up afterwards.Mr. Yawalkar, in his letter to the Rajasthan government, said Maharashtra was ready to accept the movement of students and their parents from Kota. Copies of the letter have been sent to Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. Maharashtra Youth Congress president Satyajeet Tambe, who had first raised the issue with Maharashtra and Rajasthan governments, welcomed the news. “Everyone wants to be home at times like these. We thank Maharashtra CM Uddhav Thackerayji and Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlotji for responding positively to our request,” he said. Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Prithviraj Chavan had written to Mr. Thackeray on Friday making the same request.Two weeks back, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh governments too had begun the process to bring their students back from Kota."

The 25-year-old resident of New Panvel, who works with an automobile company, received a call on April 14 from a man who said the PM Cares fund was providing money to people during the lockdown. He said she was eligible to get ₹1,000. The complainant argued that she had never heard of any such scheme but the caller convinced her that he was calling from Punjab National Bank and they are partnering with the PM Cares scheme. The caller then sent her PhonePe app link. The message said “Hey, please pay me ₹1,000 using this link.” The complainant clicked on it with the belief that the link would fetch her ₹1,000 but instead, the amount was deducted from her account. “When she told him that the money had been deducted, the caller told her that he had not received any money and sent her another message. In this manner, he sent her 10 links, of which eight were for ₹1,000 and and two of ₹10,000. The complainant clicked them all and lost ₹28,000. After realising she was being conned, she stopped clicking them,” a police officer from Khandeshwar police station said. Shubham Singh, a cyber expert said, “One should always check the authenticity of a bank account and UPI ID and get proper information from the official gov.in domain website. No NGO or government official will ever call you to donate money.”Taking advantage of virusHe said because of increased online activity, cyber criminals are actively working to exploit people in the name of COVID-19 with attacks aimed at taking advantage of the situation. “It is important now more than ever to be aware of online scams and threats as they are increasing in volume,” Mr. Singh said. The accused has been booked under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 66D (cheating by personation by using computer resource) of the IT Act."
1011,Maharashtra,"April 29, 2020 02:20 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,COVID-19 | 104 elderly referred for oxygen therapy,"After screening about 31,000 senior citizens for COVID-19 in Mumbai for two days, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) identified 104 people who had low blood oxygen levels and referred them for oxygen therapy. Age-related factors, co-morbidities and lack of oxygen support have turned out to be major factors in the city’s COVID-19 mortality rate. After many patients required oxygen support, the BMC recently directed that all isolation beds and intensive care unit beds must have oxygen support. Besides, the BMC has started a door-to-door survey focusing on senior citizens. Around 31,000 elderly people were screened since Sunday by 400 teams of community health volunteers and ASHAs. During the survey, 4,312 of them were found to have co-morbidities like diabetes, hypertension and asthma. When their blood oxygen level was monitored, 104 were found to have oxygen saturation below 95% in blood.Since they are vulnerable to COVID-19, they have been referred for oxygen therapy in designated hospitals. The BMC has set aside 300 beds for oxygen therapy in non-COVID-19 hospitals. The teams carrying out the survey are also creating awareness among communities on the novel coronavirus, how to take care of senior citizens and where to report symptoms."
1012,Maharashtra,"April 29, 2020 02:23 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,COVID-19 | SevenHills Hospital to add beds to meet surge in cases,"With the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) estimating that COVID-19 cases in the city are likely to touch 75,000 by mid-May, SevenHills Hospital will be adding 226 isolation beds, each with oxygen support, this week.About 4,000 patients are also likely to be critical by next month, and the hospital, which currently has 590 beds, aims to expand its capacity to 1,300. However, the hospital, which is dedicated to treating COVID-19 cases, is in need of more doctors and nurses to treat the influx of patients.The BMC plans to keep asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms in home quarantine, provided that they have a separate room and toilet. For those who cannot spare a room for themselves, especially residents of slums, the BMC is in the process of setting aside 40,000 beds in hotels, lodges or sports complexes as institutional quarantine centres. The BMC will also set apart 4,000 isolation beds for critical patients in dedicated COVID-19 hospitals. Of these, 1,300 will be in SevenHills Hospital, each with oxygen support.“Right now, we have 590 beds and we will add 226 by the end of this month. By May, our capacity will increase to 1,300 beds,” said IAS officer N. Ramaswami, Maharashtra Maritime Board chief, who is on special deputation at the BMC.The hospital has 18 ventilators and plans to get 32 more units. With oxygenation being provided for critical patients, the BMC expects fewer patients to require ventilator support. In COVID-19 deaths so far, the condition of patients worsened due to lack of oxygen support and they had to be put on a ventilator.Staff crunchWhile the hospital has secured the services of four to five intensivists, it requires another 225 doctors and 750 nurses to meet the surge in patients. The hospital has sought the deputation of 100 doctors and 25 senior consultants, including pulmonologists, anaesthetists and physicians, from the Maharashtra Medical Council. However, the advertisements it had recently put out seeking applications from doctors received a poor response.Mr. Ramaswami said, “Several doctors who have applied are from other States. Intern doctors will be brought on board too. We have roped in nurses from private set-ups and also nursing students. Nurses on the wait list will now be hired on an urgent basis.”To meet the dearth in dialysis technicians, the BMC will train nurses to do the job. The BMC has also decided to pay nurses a monthly stipend of ₹20,000 following protests over their poor working conditions."

The grocery market and vegetable market have one infected trader each, and a security guard has tested positive at the fruit market. Meanwhile, seven staff at Sweekar Hotel in the masala market have been infected. After a waiter tested positive on Monday, six co-workers with whom he stayed were tested and found to be positive. “Each gala where a positive case has been reported and two galas each to its right and left have been sealed,” Anil Chavan, secretary, APMC market, said.In the masala market, gala numbers 9 to 16 at K wing and the hotel were sealed, while gala numbers 889 to 897 of E wing were sealed in the vegetable market.

It has referred 1,057 cases to hospitals in the two zones for treatment.“A total of 50 mobile dispensary vans equipped with doctors, support staff and medicines are concentrating on the economically weaker localities in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. At least 46 of these vans are serving as roving dispensaries within Pune city to test people in the highly-infected wards,” said Shantilal Mutha, founder, BJS.Given that most people living in these localities could not afford to go to dispensaries, a loudspeaker in each mobile unit moving through the ‘red zones’ of the city would announce their arrival, Mr. Mutha said.“Typically, there is a pervasive fear among these sections ever since the spread of the contagion. In many cases, people suppress their ailments and do not come forward to get themselves tested. Through this initiative, we are trying to reduce the load on the overstretched municipal healthcare staff and defuse the fear among the populace in these zones by enabling early detection,” he said.Since the beginning of this month, around 65,000 people had been screened in Pune city, of whom 1,021 had been referred to hospitals, Mr. Mutha said. The organisation is operating similar mobile units in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu.The mobile units can check 2,500 people daily and can examine symptoms of an average of 500 patients each day.“Doctors in the vans monitor patients for cold and flu conditions besides informing them about preventive measures to be taken against the novel coronavirus,” said Prasan Firodia, managing director, Force Motors.The Dr. Abhay Firodia Group has also earmarked ₹25 crore to support COVID-19 relief activities, aimed at supporting upgrade of healthcare infrastructure, enhancing blood collection capability, facilitating mobile clinic and testing capabilities, and providing food to the needy, he said.With 84 vans acting as mobile units operating in other districts of Maharashtra as well as neighbouring States, 1,11,679 residents have been screened till date, of whom 1,070 suspected COVID-19 cases have been referred to government hospitals across Maharashtra."

Devendrakumar Jain, assistant commissioner of G South ward, said, “COVID-19 cases are rising in the State and we want to be prepared. The BEC halls are spacious, air-conditioned and well-maintained meeting the required medical standards. Now, 1,240 beds can be set up. The centre also has proper sanitation facilities.”Nesco will be providing meals and housekeeping services. Krishna Patel, managing director of Nesco, said, “Our central kitchen maintains the highest hygiene standards and would be the safest and most efficient option for food services.” Mr. Jain said the kitchen has the capacity to feed 15,000 people.Dipesh Singhania, group chief finance officer and head of the legal department, said the centre will be the largest quarantine facility in Mumbai. He said, “The two halls provided earlier covered 15,000 square metres.

The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which had issued notices to private labs Metropolis and Thyrocare for irregularities, is planning to allow Metropolis to continue testing in a restricted manner.Around 4,000 samples are tested for COVID-19 in the city every day at government and private labs. On Wednesday, 3,957 samples were tested. The BMC recently brought on board the National Institute for Research on Reproductive Health, a government lab, and three private labs: SRL Diagnostics, Dr. Avinash Phadke’s lab in Mahim; PD Hinduja Hospital’s lab in Mahim; and iGenetic Diagnostics in Andheri. All four labs have a capacity of testing 100 samples a day. The State now has 51 government and private testing labs with a capacity to test 10,000 samples per day.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) website, Topiwala Medical College, Sion Medical College, HBT Medical College and KJ Somaiya Medical College have also sought approval to open testing labs. In the cases of the first three, ICMR has held discussions with their management about compliances. In the case of Somaiya, ICMR website says it has not submitted the ceretificate from the National Accreditation Board for Testing and Calibration Laboratories. If these labs are approved, Mumbai’s testing capacity will increase further. An officer from the BMC’s health department said ICMR has technical specifications when it comes to the infrastructure of labs and the applicants have to comply with them. Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), said, “We have told Metropolis to be ready. We might ask them to do restrictive testing. But two to three private labs have been added to Mumbai’s capacity. JJ Hospital’s capacity has increased due to the addition of a new machine. It has a good capacity and 500 to 1,000 samples from Mumbai can be tested.”In the case of Thyrocare, he said, “We will give them a hearing, check their samples, and take a decision. The main issue was time lag; they collected more samples against capacity.” Mr. Kakani was referring to JJ Hospital borrowing a U.S.-made machine that had a capacity of testing around 2,000 samples a day. The machine was imported by a Nashik-based firm which lent it to the State government considering Mumbai’s needs. The machine will test samples from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region on a priority basis and 500 to 1,000 samples from Mumbai."

It has stressed that no patient be turned away without examination and required intervention under any circumstances. The directives will have to be implemented from 10 a.m. on May 2. As per the order signed by Chief Secretary Ajoy Mehta, all asymptomatic patients without co-morbidities should be shifted to appropriate COVID-19 care centres immediately and hospitals should ensure not to admit asymptomatic positive patients without co-morbidities. “Similar patients in private hospitals should be stamped and sent away for home quarantine after proper counselling according to the government of India guidelines,” the order said.Unique ID for admissionsIt has asked the Directors of Health Services to prepare a standard operating procedure for screening, transferring, admitting and discharging patients. In Mumbai, each patient requiring hospitalisation will be assigned a unique ID by the round-the-clock on-site team of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s disaster management department, without which admission will not be granted. “[The department] should use this more accurate and efficient bed management in all hospitals,” the order said.The government has also directed that any patient entering hospital premises for COVID-19 or other treatment should be immediately checked into the casualty ward or screening clinic and after triage, the patient may be shifted or admitted. Triage for all patientsIt said hospitals should collect swabs of all suspected COVID-19 patients on top priority and ensure that reports are collected within 12 hours. They should ensure that patients are triaged as per clinical conditions and shifted to COVID-19 care centres, dedicated COVID-19 health centres or dedicated COVID-19 hospitals.If a COVID-19 patient dies, the hospital administration has to ensure that the body is moved from the ward within 30 minutes of the death and is disposed of within 12 hours.

It began by thanking him and went on to describe in detail the treatment and expenses that were ostensibly going to be incurred. The email ended by seeking more help from the complainant.“Taken in by the reports of rising deaths from the pandemic on a daily basis, the complainant transferred ₹80,000 more to the account,” the officer said. However, when he got a third email asking for a further sum of ₹1 lakh, he smelt a rat and called his friend to ask why so much money was needed. The friend, however, said, no one in his family was suffering from COVID-19. The complainant subsequently registered a first information report, the officer said.The police have registered a complaint for cheating and impersonation against unknown persons under the Indian Penal Code and the Information Technology Act, and are seeking assistance from the cyber police to investigate the case.Cyber police officers said the racket was similar to those that capitalise on current affairs trends to dupe people.“Hacking email accounts and sending mass emails to all contacts seeking monetary help citing an emergency is an old modus operandi and only the supposed emergency changes in line with current affairs,” said an officer with the Maharashtra Cyber Unit.COVID-19, the officer, said, is an obvious choice as it has us all scared and if the email comes from a close friend, the first instinct is to send the money first and ask questions later. “Hacking the email account is even simpler, especially if basic cyber security hygiene such as not keeping accounts logged in to public devices and changing passwords often is not followed strictly,” the officer said."

All district collectors will be the designated nodal authority for receiving and sending stranded people between States/Union Territories and also within the State.Any group coming into Maharashtra will have to strictly follow the 14-day quarantine period, which will be ensured by collectors/municipal commissioners. These people will be assessed by local health authorities and kept in home quarantine, unless they need to be institutionally quarantined.The State guidelines have clarified that all who wish to travel will be screened and only those who do not show symptoms of influenza or COVID-19 shall be allowed to proceed. The letter given to them shall clearly mention that the people have been screened and are found to be asymptomatic. The vehicles being used or deployed to transport the people will bear a transit pass issued by the authority from the starting area. The pass given to them will be for a fixed route and with specific validity, and carry the names of the persons travelling.‘Bandra one-off incident’The Bombay High Court has said the gathering of over a thousand migrants outside Bandra station earlier this month was a one-off incident, and refused to pass urgent orders in a plea seeking deployment of adequate security personnel in the city.A single Bench of Justice B.P. Colabawalla made the observation on April 27 while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) via videoconferencing filed by three residents of Bandra, Khar and Mahim. The petitioners said they were directly aggrieved by the April 14 incident and raised concern about the serious security lapse that led to the gathering in front of the station.The petitioners said such gatherings would increase the chance of the spread of COVID-19. The plea said, “They [the petitioners] would be the first in line to be afflicted by the coronavirus once a spike is recorded which is directly attributable to the incident.”The migrant workers had gathered outside the station demanding transport arrangements for them to return to their native places. The migrants were later dispersed and assured that they will be provided accommodation and food till the lockdown lasts. The plea urged the court to pass directions “to the government to make an assessment for requesting the aid of the military to be deployed in such vulnerable and red zones in support of the authorities of a State”.The PIL also sought “reports regarding the availability of Armed Forces, Central Reserve Police Force and State Reserve Police Force to be deployed in Mumbai should the need arise”.Refusing to accept the petitioners’ argument that the Bandra incident demands urgent orders to be passed, The Bench said, “These are extraordinary times and the government and the civic authorities are doing their best to keep things under control. One incident does not make out an urgency and the court is sure that the government and the civic authorities will do whatever is necessary to ensure that an incident like the one that took place at Bandra will be avoided until the lockdown is effective.”Rejecting the plea, Justice Colabawalla said, “I do not find any case is made out for urgent ad-interim relief. All these directions, and if required, can always be passed by the court when normal work resumes.”(With inputs from Sonam Saigal)"

At the same time, we must take cautious steps to ensure the infection does not flare up again and the present gains are not lost. Normal life has to be restored carefully,” he said in a special address to mark 60 years of Maharashtra’s formation.Admitting that economic activity has come to halt and could lead to a surge in unemployment, the CM said: “But, along with finance, priority must be given to the real resource of any nation — its people. Lives of people must be saved so that we all can extricate the society from this battle.”Tread with cautionUrging people to exercise extreme caution in red zones (red, orange and green zones have been demarcated based on the intensity of cases), Mr. Thackeray said Mumbai and its neighbouring areas like Kalyan, Dombivali, Panvel, Pune and surrounding areas, as well as parts of Nagpur and Sambhajinagar are in the red for now, with COVID-19 cases rising gradually.“At present, it is not in our interest to restart normal activities there. In the orange zone, which includes districts with active cases, we are planning to increase activities, barring in some areas. We are gradually removing restrictions in green zones,” said Mr. Thackeray.Mumbai and other municipal corporations are using pulse oximeters on a door-to-door basis, especially in slums, to check people’s oxygen levels. “Over 2 lakh people have been examined. This helps us know about the oxygen levels, especially among those with diabetes and hypertension, as they are more vulnerable,” the Chief Minister said.Mr. Thackeray said that based on the Centre’s permissions, those who want to leave for other States will be allowed to do so, only with due discipline and precautions and after speaking to those States. “Similarly, even those wanting to return to Maharashtra will be allowed. States are in touch with each other for this transfer. Transport facilities will be provided for those wanting to leave,” he said."

Earlier, the BMC was working at 50% strength following government guidelines. Differently-abled staffers and those over 55 years with co-morbidities have been exempted from field duties.The move comes after COVID-19 claimed its first victim in the BMC this week. A 49-year-old assessment inspector from G North ward engaged in food distribution in Dharavi tested positive following his death. ‘Need more manpower’The BMC, in its order, said, “It was observed that 50% attendance made it difficult to implement measures for COVID-19. The previous order has been cancelled and 100% attendance has been made mandatory. Large-scale manpower is needed to man COVID-19 care centres and containment zones.”The BMC has directed all assistant commissioners to book hotel rooms for employees engaged in providing essential services. The civic body has formulated room tariffs to be adhered to while booking hotel rooms. Taj group of hotels has agreed to house BMC employees at Taj Mahal Palace at ₹2,000 per room, including meals and laundry service. The decision has been taken as most employees live in the suburbs and struggle to commute to work.Employees living in areas outside Mumbai limits such as Panvel, Vasai, Badlapur, and Asangaon have been allowed to work from their nearest ward offices. They will be engaged in contact tracing, quarantine centre management, upgrading municipal hospitals or pre-monsoon work. The ward offices will submit reports to the respective departments the employees belong to.Pay cuts for absenteesThe BMC said memos will be issued to employees who remain absent. Salary will be cut if they still fail to report to work and action will be taken under the Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897. This rule will not apply to staffers who report sick.The order has exempted 60% of BMC staff who are above 55 years with diabetes, hypertension and kidney ailments. Those who continue to work will get a daily allowance of ₹300.However, employees’ unions are unhappy with the move. Sainath Rajyadhyaksha, president, Municipal Engineers’ Union, said, “The Centre has exempted all employees above 50 years, then why has the BMC set the limit at 55?”Charter of demands The union has written to the BMC commissioner with demands such as declaring staff who die of COVID-19 as ‘martyrs’, giving compensation and jobs to their families, testing of all frontline workers, rotational duty, and insurance cover of ₹1 crore for all employees."

For others, the capped prices will come into effect once they exhaust their medical cover. The decision comes after several patients with COVID-19 and other ailments highlighted the exorbitant cost of treatment at private hospitals.The notification issued by principal secretary Dr. Pradeep Vyas on Thursday states that hospitals should charge the lowest rates for procedures as per their pacts with insurance companies. Hospitals without such tie-ups will have to adhere to the capped rates for over 170 procedures like general surgeries, neurosurgery, and cardiac, obstetric, gynaecology, ophthalmology, and orthopaedic operations. Angiography has been capped at ₹12,000, angioplasty with one stent at ₹1.20 lakh, dialysis at ₹2,500, and knee replacement at ₹1.60 lakh.Tie-ups with insurersMost hospitals in Mumbai, Pune, Navi Mumbai, Panvel and Thane are members of the General Insurers’ Public Sector Association under the preferred provider network and have fixed treatment package rates worked out based on the type of hospital, infrastructure, and facilities. Other hospitals in the State have agreements with third party administrators under which treatment package rates are fixed.Dr. Sudhakar Shinde, CEO of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, said, “As per the notification, if a non-insured patient visits any of these hospitals, he or she should be charged as per their lowest treatment packages, irrespective of whether the patient is admitted in a general or deluxe category.”Dr. Shinde said hospitals now cannot levy charges as per their rack rates after patients exhaust their medical cover. He said the notification has invoked the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act, the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act, the Mumbai Nursing Homes Registration Act and the Bombay Public Trusts Act. “We are in difficult times now and have urged all hospitals to comply with these norms,” he said. The notification also states that hospitals should not charge more than a 10% markup on net procurement costs incurred on personal protective equipment, consumables, pacemakers, stents, and medical implants.‘Under financial strain’The CEO of a Mumbai hospital said the price cap will make it difficult for private hospitals to sustain themselves. He said, “We are already struggling with staff being quarantined after being exposed to COVID-19 patients. There is the additional burden of testing staff, arranging their transport during the lockdown, and paying their salaries even when they are off duty in quarantine. Hospitals are already facing many losses.”Mum on COVID-19 costsThe notification, however, does not elaborate on capping the cost of COVID-19 treatment. While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has capped the rates of isolation beds at ₹3,000, the bills of many COVID-19 patients have crossed ₹5 lakh. Health minister Rajesh Tope said some hospitals have charged patients ₹1 lakh for a day of treatment. He said the notification will help prevent hospitals from charging exorbitant rates."

1026,Maharashtra,"May 05, 2020 02:38 IST",Other States,Mumbai,Wine stores opening: delay in official orders causes confusion,"Only around 150 of the 475 wine stores in Mumbai opened on Monday, after staying closed for over a month, but each saw a long line of customers outside. Though the government allowed non-essential shops, including wine stores to open in the red zones of Mumbai and Pune as well on Sunday, the official order permitting the same reached sellers only on Monday afternoon. “Today, only about 150-200 wine stores could open for about three hours as we received the order around 2.30 p.m. and the closing time was 6 p.m.,” Dilip Giyanani, chairman, Maharashtra Wine Shop Owners Association said. ‘Law and order issue’ Most wine shop owners who managed to open for the few hours said there was intense pressure from the customers and maintaining law and order was a noticeable issue. “We noticed a couple of issues. First, that we would need help of the law and order machinery. The local police have been helpful. Another is sanitising the shop every two hours. How are we going to do this? The third is about accepting currency notes as one would eventually have to touch it,” Mr. Giyanani said.For most wine store owners, tallying the stocks and brands in their shops took time as many didn’t remember the exact count since business had come to an abrupt halt. Mr. Giyanani said a majority of stores had supplies to last another 15 days. “Since it is summer right now, beer is in demand. There are several trucks lined up at breweries waiting for permissions to move,” he said, adding that manpower was among the biggest issues being faced on the business front.“Most of the staff live in distant suburbs and there is no public transport. Also, we would not want them to travel right now. I have made arrangements at a nearby hotel for my staff who can reach here,” said Randip Singh Munjral, owner of Crawford Market’s Shah and Company, one of the largest liquor outlets in Mumbai. In absence of staff, Mr. Munjral was unable to start business.He said the government’s move to allow liquor sales should be a win-win situation for all. “Mumbai is in the red zone, maybe we could have waited for a few days more. Distributors have also not opened as yet. They too have staffing issues. Vehicles will need passes to travel from warehouses in the suburbs to town,” he said, adding that despite all this, the liquor trade was working out modalities.“We want to set the ball rolling. Around 90% of our sales will be by card or UPI payments. Cash will be a strict no for now,” Mr. Munjral said. Reports from other parts of the State indicated that in some rural areas, queues outside wine stores extended up to 3 km, while customers not maintaining social distancing led to some shops being asked to shut down. At Sahar Road in Andheri, police had to resort to mild lathi charge as customers got unruly. ‘Help encash stock’ Meanwhile, the Hotel and Restaurant Association of Western India (HRAWI) in a letter to the State government sought permission to liquidate perishable liquor stocks lying with them. Gurbaxish Singh Kohli, president, HRAWI said an estimated ₹10 crore worth of stock was lying with all license holders. The goods, including liquors and beers, are likely to perish due to the expiry of the products. The association said allowing liquidation of the unsold stock will minimise losses and introduce working capital by encashment.“The hospitality industry is under lockdown now for almost 45 days. Further, all sale of liquor have been prohibited by declaration of dry day pursuant to the order issued by the State excise department. But now with the government relaxing the ban on sale of liquor we are hoping to salvage from the unsold stock which in turn can induce some liquidity into our businesses. This will introduce working capital for many establishments that are bleeding in outgoing expenses and are sitting on dormant stocks,” Mr. Kohli said.In the letter, HRAWI requested that either it directs manufacturers to replace liquor stocks that are on the verge of expiry or already expired or allow the sale of perishable liquor stocks from the outlets of license holders, as and when the same is advisable, under the present circumstances.“Under the present situation of chaos at the liquor shops across the country, we believe allowing all FL3 licensees to sell liquor would help the cause of social distancing, maintaining law and order and reducing the risk of crowding at public places. Our suggestion is only complementary to the government’s decision of allowing sale of liquor in the State. Being a highly capital and labour intensive industry, we need something to work with, something that allows us to continue to remain in business. We are hopeful that the government takes into account our catastrophic situation during the phase of the lockdown and allows us this opportunity to survive,” Mr. Kohli said."
1027,Maharashtra,"May 06, 2020 01:16 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,Strength in numbers: Mumbai reaches out to feed 3.5 lakh people in just a week,"It took just one week of working 24x7 at breakneck speed for Mumbai to prove that people, irrespective of class, agenda or agency, can come together for a humanitarian call.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), corporate houses, the police, the State government, NGOs, mathadi workers and volunteers, sourcing chains and a social enterprise poured their hearts and collated their energies into the Slum Relief Drive, one of the city’s biggest COVID-19 relief efforts so far. Together, they supported 70,455 families with ration kits which will last for two weeks, feed 3.5 lakh people and serve nearly one crore meals.The pace of the operation was as dizzying as the scale. From April 13 to 21, more than 1,500 tonnes of material worth over ₹6 crore was mobilised in the five biggest containment zones: G South, E, D, K West and H East wards.The driving force was philanthropist Amit Chandra’s A.T.E. Chandra Foundation, the ground work was managed by Praja Foundation and various NGOs, the BMC gave out the requisite permissions, social enterprise Donatekart Direct helped with the operational part, while philanthropists chipped in with the funds (see box).“No one slept for the first three to four days. In the last two days, work proceeded on a war footing,” Sarang Bobade, COO, Donatekart, said.How it worked outWhen the lockdown was announced, a few individuals working closely with the government examined data on where most of the novel coronavirus cases in the city were. Mr. Chandra, chairman of Bain Capital; Noshir Kaka, senior partner and global leader, analytics, McKinsey and Co.; and Ajay Piramal, chairman of the Piramal Group, got talking and realised that the bulk of the cases were in five wards. “It became evident to us that the war was being fought in a highly concentrated way,” Mr. Chandra said.They concluded that from a human perspective and to contain the disease, the problem of hunger needed to be solved in the containment zones.Laying the groundThe ‘what’ had been figured; the ‘how’ was the more difficult part. Nobody could enter the containment zones, and packaged food could not be sent as the supply chain was broken during the lockdown. The police were imposing restrictions on movement, the BMC did not want people queuing, and a kitchen could not be set up in containment zones. Because of these limitations, the team thought of bringing in a partner with an understanding of working on the ground.Mr. Chandra connected with Praja Foundation, a policy organisation that works to increase accountability in governance. Praja would leverage its relationships MLAs and councillors that had been cultivated over decades. “Councillors have an amazing outreach,” said Milind Mhaske, director, Praja. “We would get them do the last-mile delivery.”"

Senior civic officials and healthcare staff above 55 years with co-morbidities, and differently-abled employees remain exempted from duty.Sainath Rajyadhyaksha, president of Municipal Engineers’ Union, said, “The previous rule led to chaos owing to severe lack of transportation facilities. All employees travel in the same bus, even those who visit containment zones. That is why many civic workers tested positive for COVID-19.” Mr. Rajyadhyaksha said train services should be resumed to ferry staff providing essential services. He said, “Like the Central government, BMC should also exempt all employees above 50 years from duty.”"

All the schools will also have to give parents the option of paying fees online during the period of lockdown, the GR said.The State government has already issued a notification directing schools to not force parents to pay fees of the previous or next year. The GR, dated March 30, directed schools to collect fees only after lockdown ends.“The government is responding to the demands of the parents to ensure they don’t face any hardship in this time. The department had received complaints about schools demanding pending fees even in lockdown time and therefore we issued the notification on March 30,” said an official. Parents, he added, are also worried about the post-corona scenario, both economically and socially. “At such a time, we decided to ensure that they are not burdened with extra expenditure in the form of increased school fees.

The vans will be deployed by the disaster control room.The video triggered a lot of criticism for the BMC and the State government from Opposition parties and civil society. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was reportedly miffed at the incident, said to be one of the reasons for the transfer of former municipal commissioner Praveen Pardeshi.Though the government has given strict orders to move bodies out of hospitals within 12 hours, there are delays as relatives may take time to claim the bodies due to either the lockdown or because they themselves are quarantined. Shortage of staff to wrap bodies and the lack of hearse vans and drivers, or drivers refusing to transport bodies, are other reasons.The BMC has tied up with an agency to deploy the vans at major COVID-19 hospitals such as Nair, K.E.M., and Cooper. Every van comes with a driver and attendant. The BMC has deployed 72 labourers to carry the body into the van.“This is not happening because of the video. We had already started receiving complaints of the lack of these vans and that is why we increased the number to 36 from 15. We are getting 65 more labourers from the agency for the job.

At 3 p.m. on Sunday, as the inflow of workers from Maharashtra and Gujarat swelled, an overwhelmed police force gave up checking for permits. No one was being screened for illness nor were social distancing norms observed.Vehicles — especially open trucks — were stopped intermittently to allow waiting workers, clutching backpacks and cycles, to get in. “SP sahab has given orders. Don’t drop them midway,” a young constable warned a truck driver.For the stranded and hapless workers, the searing heat had flipped the daily rhythm — they walked and pedalled at night, and slept through the day.“Just look how they are going back,” said a policeman from Madhya Pradesh. “This is a humanitarian problem, not a law and order one.”On Saturday, around 50,000 workers had crossed the border, but by Sunday night, twice that number had entered Madhya Pradesh. A policeman from Maharashtra, slumped in a chair, wondered: “Will our economy work if they leave like this?”When Madhya Pradesh had earlier refused to accept workers bound for Uttar Pradesh, he confessed that the police had suggested the workers take alternative routes to avoid detection. “How can someone be stopped from going back home,” he asked. Then, the held-up workers had begun throwing stones, injuring three policemen.Among the vehicles were several auto rickshaws and taxis, bearing the Mumbai, Pune and Nashik registration numbers, heading for Uttar Pradesh. “For the first time, I am riding my rickshaw this long, on a highway,” said Umakant Sharma who was returning to Prayagraj. “I will return after the lockdown ends.”"
1044,Maharashtra,"May 12, 2020 17:00 IST",Other States,Mumbai,Maharashtra panel decides to release 50% prisoners,"In a move to decongest prisons in Maharashtra, especially after the outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19) in Arthur Road jail that has infected at least 184 prisoners and 26 jail officials, a high power committee on Monday decided to release 50% of the total 35,239 inmates across the State prisons. The committee consists of Justice A.A. Sayed of the Bombay High Court, along with Additional Chief Secretary (Home) Sanjay Chahande and Director-General of Prisons S.N. Pandey.Mr. Chahande told The Hindu that prisoners would be released in due course of time. He said legislation such as the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act, the Maharashtra Protection of Interest of Depositors, the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act and others were exempted from being considered.Also read: Decongest jails temporarily: PUDRThe order, a copy of which is with The Hindu, however, does not state the time frame within which the prisoners will be released, and neither does it reveal the category of prisoners who will be released.Contrary to decisionThe move is contrary to the March 25 decision of the committee where it had decided to release 11,000 prisoners. Since March 25, more than 5,000 prisoners having minor or moderate charges against them have been released.But this was not sufficient as courts were not granting bail to many accused, and the virus outbreak at Arthur Road jail had seen unrest within its premises with inmates protesting for their release, particularly because the jail, with a capacity to hold just 800 prisoners, was overpopulated with 2,700 prisoners, and the jail authorities had expressed their inability to handle an outbreak as early as March 2020. Superintendent’s letterThe Superintendent of Arthur Road prison, in a letter to the courts, had categorically stated that it would be impossible to maintain social distancing in the jail considering it had 2,700 inmates. Despite the letter, the court has not only refused bail to prisoners having serious ailments, but also refused bail to a person infected with COVID-19. Even as the committee decided to release 50% inmates on Monday, it rejected a petition filed by advocate S.B. Talekar to release prisoners charged or convicted under the Special Acts such as MCOCA, PMLA, MPID, NDPS and UAPA.Also read: Tihar releases 400 inmates to decongest prisons“In any event, the prisoners charged/convicted under the Special Acts including the MPID Act cannot claim to be released from prison as of right. It is required to be noted that the offences under the MPID Act are against a large number of victims who are mostly poor depositors, and whose interests are required to be safeguarded and recoveries made from properties,” said the order.The committee said, “It is true that so far as MPID Act is concerned, there are no restrictive provisions for grant of bail. However, it would be necessary to look at the facts on case to case basis by a judicial mind before releasing such prisoners, who are generally known to be more resourceful, after considering the likelihood of them absconding and/or tampering with evidence or witnesses and/or blocking the recoveries to be made from the properties and in a given case it would be necessary to secure.”The committee, however, clarified that ‘it would always be open to such prisoners to apply for regular bail which would be decided in accordance with law’."

While the destination for a majority of the passengers was New Delhi, for others it was a stop closer to home.Shakir Hussain, who works in a salon in Ghatkopar (West), said he had been trying to go back home to Moradabad since the State government decided to issue permits. “I, along with three others, live in the salon and were being helped by our boss. The lockdown has hit his business too and there is no saying when the salon will reopen,” he said, adding that his boss had paid for his 3AC ticket. Mr. Hussain said he did not yet know how he would get to Moradabad from Delhi. “In the worst case, I’ll walk,” he said.Mayank Dattaraya, a resident of Jaipur taking the train to Kota, said he was getting paid only 30% of his salary due to the lockdown. “Intra-State travel is not as hard as inter-State travel. I had come to the city earlier this year,” he said. Many were going back home to meet their loved ones. One such was Mamta Khatri, a resident of Airoli who was wearing personal protective gear. She was on her way to Gurgaon to meet her pregnant daughter.Among other passengers was Krishna Kanojia, who had come from Ajmer to visit her daughter in Ghatkopar, and got stuck here. “We will get off at Kota and organise a taxi for the three-hour ride to Ajmer,” she said. Imamuddin from Delhi said he had come to Mumbai for a business trip and had a reserved ticket on the Rajdhani Express leaving on March 23. “I was fortunate that my friend asked me to stay with him for a few days. Otherwise living in a hotel for a month would not have been financially possible,” he said. Western Railway (WR) had made adequate arrangements on Tuesday for physical distancing and queuing of people. In the concourse area of Mumbai Central, they had demarcated seats into two zones between which were the medical testing kiosks. On the platforms as well, people were asked to maintain distance. “The process was very smooth and we were given water inside the coach,” said Prateek Sharma, who had come from Mira Road and was going back home to Delhi. A VFX artist, Mr. Sharma said since there was no certainty on when the film industry would start, he and his friend decided to return home.While everyone seemed pleased with the facilities and processes, some suggested a few improvements. “They should have allowed those who came first to board first. We were waiting inside the holding area for nearly two hours, where there were no toilet facilities,” said Sanjay Sonputre, on his way to Surat with his wife. Others, who had to wait in the sun, said in jest that their temperature would increase during the waiting period. G.V.L. Satyakumar, Divisional Railway Manager, Mumbai, said they would have a queue on the platform next to the road so that people did not have to stand in the sun."

All equipment has been procured. The work to set up oxygen lines is also under way,” B.G. Pawar, MMRDA spokesperson, said. The MMRDA started building the hospital on the exhibition grounds at BKC on March 27. The grounds did not have critical facilities such as sewage lines, water and electricity connections, all of which have now been provided. The hospital will also have a pathology lab with facilities for blood tests, an ECG machine, and rooms for doctors and nurses. It will be housed in a waterproof ‘German tent’ (a hangar-like structure) spanning 235 m in length and 40 m in width. MMRDA officials said the facility is designed to be operational through the monsoon.On Wednesday, Aaditya Thackeray and Aslam Sheikh, guardian ministers for Mumbai suburban and Mumbai city districts respectively, visited the site to oversee its progress.

The police are working in extremely challenging conditions for long hours due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown, Mr. Deshmukh said. “Besides, Id falls on May 25 when we will need augmented security to maintain law and order. Hence we have sought urgent deployment of 20 CAPF companies,” he said.The 32 Central Reserve Police Force companies already deployed in the State are working in tandem with the Maharashtra police. “Many police personnel have tested positive for COVID-19 and need time to rest and recuperate,” the Minister added. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray too had indicated in his recent address that the State would approach the Centre. “The State police have been working tirelessly for months now.

1051,Maharashtra,"May 15, 2020 01:17 IST",Mumbai,Mumbai,BMC struggles to dispose of COVID-19 waste,"The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) is struggling with safe disposal of the nearly five metric tonnes of COVID-19 waste being generated in containment zones, care centres and hospitals every day.Apart from the fact that biomedical waste is not being segregated at source, the already-stretched corporation is facing a labour shortage.“Even though we have annual contracts for collection and transportation of waste, we have a large number of temporary workers who do odd jobs for us. They are mostly gone,” said an officer from the solid waste management department. “With our staff engaged in sweeping, collection, transportation of waste as well as disinfection, sanitation activities, we are stretched,” the officer pointed out.Less wasteThe city is generating less waste on account of the lockdown: about 4,500 metric tonnes (MT) every day, as against 7,500 MT earlier. However, the disposal of waste from COVID-19 zones is proving to be a challenge.The Central Pollution Control Board has given detailed guidelines about the handling of COVID-19 waste from hospitals, care centres, quarantined buildings, containment zones, and pathology laboratories.Based on the guidelines, the BMC has distributed yellow bags in quarantined households for residents to dispose of used masks and gloves. The bags are sent to the Biomedical Waste Treatment Facility at Deonar for incineration after spraying disinfectant. All conservancy staff handling yellow and black bags are given protective gear and disinfectants.Other waste from the quarantined homes and neighbouring buildings is treated as solid waste, collected in black bags, disinfected and given a ‘deep burial’ in a pit at Deonar dumping ground. The transportation vehicles in both cases are sanitised immediately.Waste generated from pathology labs and hospitals is put into double bags, loaded into separate trucks for COVID-19 waste (the bags and the trucks are labelled ‘biomedical waste’), transported to the Deonar facility, sprayed with disinfectant and burnt immediately.While COVID-19 waste is strictly disposed of at the waste treatment facility at Deonar run by a private contractor, waste from containment zones is being collected by BMC.The private company, SMS, has deployed 15 trucks in Mumbai for COVID-19 waste, each with a driver and labourer with personal protective equipment. It picks up five to six tonnes of COVID-19 waste and about 10 tonnes of other biomedical waste every day.Like the BMC, the contractor too faces a shortage of labour. “The biggest problem for us is our labourers. They are under pressure from their family and neighbours to not do this job, so much so that we had to give them a monetary incentive to get them to work,” said Amit Nilawar, former director and currently shareholder of the company.No segregationAnother issue is that COVID-19 waste is not segregated at source in containment zones, some of which have a population of nearly a lakh.“We have distributed yellow bags to everyone but we find biomedical waste mixed in regular waste often,” said the BMC officer quoted earlier. “According to CPCB guidelines, when a person has COVID-19, all his contacts have to be home-quarantined, and their houses are to be treated the same way as the patient’s, but waste from neighbouring houses is mixed with the rest. That is why we are giving PPEs to our drivers as well as labourers in containment zones,” said the officer."

With no bed available, the doctors told him to sit wherever he could find space and started him on an intravenous drip. As anxiety of being in a crowded place set in, he asked his wife to take him back home as soon as the drip finished. His condition deteriorated at home and he died the next day.‘Chaos at hospital’“He was sitting on a chair with the saline bottle. The chaos at the hospital made him restless,” his 26-year-old nephew told The Hindu over phone from Poddar Hospital, where he is in quarantine with four other family members. His uncle’s samples were collected at KEM and returned positive after his death. “If he had been admitted immediately, he would have been alive,” he said.Unavailability of beds has been a crucial problem with patients being shunted from one hospital to another.The family of a 57-year-old man from Shivaji Nagar, who passed away this month, had a similar story. The man complained of breathing difficulty and was rushed to a hospital in Ghatkopar. The family was told they were admitting only COVID-19 patients, and doctors did not suspect he was infected. They took him to another hospital in Kurla. “They checked his blood oxygen level which was very low and said they could not admit him,” said the deceased’s 32-year-old son. He then took his father to Somaiya, Shatabdi and Rajawadi hospitals where no beds were available. “After roaming around for eight hours, we got him admitted to KEM where he died three days later on May 3,” he said.Another 44-year-old, who worked in a shipping company at Masjid Bunder, was taken to four hospitals — Joy, Rajawadi, Kasturba and Nair — where beds were full. He was admitted to St. George Hospital, where he died.The city has 4,678 beds for COVID-19 patients, of which over 1,000 beds are in the private sector. “We are augmenting beds to ensure 24x7 availability for patients in need.

The matter will be discussed in the State Cabinet as well. Authorities in Solapur, Pandharpur and Satara would also be consulted,” Mr. Pawar said.Speaking to The Hindu, Abhay Tilak of the Sant Dnyaneshwar Maharaj Sansthan in Alandi said that representatives of all temple committees are unanimous in their view that this ancient wari should not be disrupted.Changes proposed“We have presented detailed proposals on how a modified wari can be organised so that the palkhi procession does not lead to any spread of infection,” he said. These include allowing fewer people, just 400, to participate in the procession carrying the palkhis, or a mere 100 kirtan (devotional poetry) singers.“If the situation remains grave by May-end, a symbolic wari involving 30 people, who would make the journey to Pandharpur by vehicles, could be considered as a last resort,” Mr. Tilak said.Advocate Vikas Dhage-Patil, chief trustee, said, “People seated in the chariot carrying the footprints of the saints, and those accompanying the procession, would have to undergo medical examinations. We will also be adhering to strict physical distancing guidelines.” Mr. Tilak said this glorious tradition, where an estimated 10-12 lakh devotees from not only Maharashtra, but also neighbouring Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh participate, has been disrupted only twice in the past. “It was not held in 1912, probably due to the plague, and the second time in 1945, though the reason for that is unknown,” he said."

Delay in shifting positive patients from quarantine centres to isolation facilities puts other people in quarantine at risk of contracting the infection. It also could lead to the emergence of new clusters of the novel coronavirus from such centres.Neighbour succumbsThe son said their neighbour had succumbed to COVID-19 two weeks ago. He then took his father for screening at a fever camp at Government Colony in Bandra on May 12. “We live in a chawl in Bharat Nagar in Bandra.

According to Pratap Chandra Pradhan, convenor Prabasi Odisha Sharamik Sangathan (Migrant Odisha Workers’ Organisation), over 2,000 of them are now stranded in Chennai, while around 600 are in Ernakulam of Kerala. There are also stranded Odia migrant labourers in different parts of Maharashtra and Gujarat.When contacted over phone, Jatia Mahakud of Jugudi-Balabhadrapur village of Samakhemundi block of Ganjam district described the plight faced by him and labourers in Chennai.

According to him, around 600 Odia migrant labourers like him are now staying in groups at different places of Ernakulam. “Our greatest worry is that we have no money with us. As we are not in a position to pay our house rent, our house owners may ask us to vacate,” he said. These daily wagers were searching for work on a daily basis in different sectors in Kerala. Since March 22, due to lockdown, they are unable to get any work or income.Odisha Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik on Thursday urged his counterparts in other States to take care of stranded Odia labourers.

1067,Odisha,"March 27, 2020 23:53 IST",Other States,BHUBANESWAR,Coronavirus: Migrants’ homecoming seen with suspicion in Odisha,"Tapan Kumar Nayak, Inspector at the Rajnagar police station under Odisha’s Kendrapara district, has been receiving frantic calls of late. Callers often complain about their neighbours either roaming outside their homes or sneezing and coughing.The calls, however, do not surprise Mr. Nayak. He looks after the law and order situation in Rajnagar, where the concentration of migrant labourers is perhaps one of the densest in the country.Ever since the COVID-19 pandemic made headlines, the migrant labourers’ homecomings have been seen with suspicion and the police officer’s primary role has been not to let the skepticism assume the shape of ostracisation. The tiny block has so far received 52 migrant labourers from abroad and 566 from other States.Pattamundai, the adjacent block which sends plumbers to almost all corners of India and several foreign countries, has been witnessing an identical situation. The administration is now on its toes to make home isolation smoother for migrant workers.‘Restraint advised’“Police personnel in four vehicles do regular patrolling to ensure that those who are under home quarantine are not threatened. At the same time, we also advise migrant workers to adopt restraint and not put others lives in danger by coming out of their homes,” said Mr. Nayak.Hundreds of kilometres away in the western Odisha district of Kalahandi, 12 migrant workers who returned from Kerala had to stay under polythene sheet for several days before being allowed in their village.In Sinapali block of Nuapada district, the migrant labourers were made to undergo medical tests and only after that they could enter their villages.As 82,000 migrant workers have already landed in their respective villages and fellow villagers are insisting on their self-quarantine, the situation in remote villages may become chaotic in the coming days.“Everybody is scared. Villagers are aware of the threat COVID-19 poses. In the absence of proper education about what self-quarantine means, migrant labourers have to bear the brunt and are often subjected to humiliation,” said Umi Daniel, a prominent expert on migration issues.Mr. Daniel said a unique initiative called telephone-based virtual community volunteers has been initiated to reach out to people in the migration-prone areas.“We have started enrolling volunteers to clear confusion on the ground. Many educated people are now at home. We will rope them in so that they could pass on the right kind of message to their own community members,” he said.Purpose defeatedIn villagers, many thatched houses are either one-room or two-room without functional individual latrines. The home quarantine insisted by government loses its significance when family members have to be crammed in a small house. To address some practical issues, virtual volunteers are targeting 50 panchayats in Balangir, Bargarh, Kalahandi, Nuapada and Subarnapur districts for spreading awareness on COVID-19 threat and managing their lives."

The same is then sent out through different social media channels at the appointed time of worship. We have been doing this after the government issued an alert about the unfolding situation,” said Paresh Das, Secretary, Church of Christ (Union Church).“After the government alert was issued, the church premises have been kept closed. Besides the Sunday worship, we have prayer, Bible study, women's and youth programmes through the week, which are also being made available in the homes using the same technology”, he said.“The beauty of it is that all these worships are now being watched by people around the world who are blessed,” Mr. Das said.“This coastal region has faced three major cyclones in the past two decades. But it could never interrupt Sunday prayers in the church. This is, perhaps, the first time since the inception of the capital city we are not congregating for worship in the church. However, we extend full cooperation to the authorities as we realise the need of the hour,” he said.The 140-year-old JELC authorities said old-timers apprehended the suspension of Sunday worship. However, everyone was happy to participate in prayer even though they were not able to be physically present in the church.On a Sunday, the pastor would go to the church and lead the worship before empty benches. But the prayer would be beamed live through social media. As most of people have got smartphones they could watch and participate in the worship live. Technology had been helping the people to tide over this unprecedented crisis, said church sources.“The worship is linked to people’s faith. Although people are emotional about worship, they are also aware about the life-threatening potential of this Coronavirus. It is important to protect one’s life as well as those of others’,” said Asish Pal, Bishop of JELC Church.Bishop Pal said, “we had never faced such a situation in our history that we had to suspend prayer in churches. Nearly about 500 congregations in undivided Koraput district alone have been debarred from coming to worship. Churches are following the lockdown measures prescribed by both the State and the Central governments.”Holy Week celebration unlikely in churchesChurches said there was now little possibility of holding the Holy Week celebration of Good Friday and Easter Sunday in the churches in April second week. In the Easter Sunday prayer, about 5000 people gather at the cemetery at Jeypore.Meanwhile, civil society organisations have decided to take the help of the public address system available in 75 temples in western Odisha to make people aware about COVID-19. “We are already in discussion with village heads to allow use of loudspeakers for making people aware about the extraordinary situation,” said social activist Saroj Barik."

However, the presence of Dhaneswar Podha, a Naib Sarpanch, helps calm the nerves.For the past one month, Mr. Podha has been constantly motivating about 90 migrant labourers stranded in Tamil Nadu and their family members back home in Odisha to stay calm.Rescued as a bonded labourer from Andhra Pradesh a few years ago, he is now readying isolation centres for prospective returnees at his village, while bringing all his experience of being an exploited migrant to play during a crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.“More than the physical infrastructure, the mental sturdiness would help tide over the crisis. Migrant workers have already spent a month in a state of idleness and uncertainty. Persuading them to undergo quarantine for another 14 days will be very difficult task,” said 30-year-old Mr. Podha.In 2012, he, along with his wife and children, were rescued from a brick kiln in Gudur in Andhra Pradesh. Using the rehabilitation assistance of ₹20,000 received under Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act, 1976, he rebuilt his life and went on to become Naib Sarpanch.“I had gone to work in a brick kiln for six months’ wage of ₹40,000 for me and my wife. Upon reaching their, the brick kiln operator refused to pay the wage and forced us to work in the kiln. The mental trauma I had gone through then was unbearable,” said Mr. Podha.

As there are only 20 beds available, he is now in search of more vacant buildings that can be converted into isolation facilities.Comforting othersTalking to migrant workers over phone, he tells them not to lose patience and hope. The Naib Sarpanch also kept reminding them of spending 14 days in quarantine. “Dhaneswar Podha lives in the community. He had experienced trauma previously. His words of solace will carry more weight,” said Jyoti Prakash Brahma, who works with Aide et Action, an international voluntary organization.Jagadish Thapa in remote Chandotara village in Balangir district reveals a similar story. He was working as a bonded labourer and had faced abuse and threat at his workplace in Karnataka before being rescued. Upon his rescue, he used a small sum as capital to become an agricultural entrepreneur. Now, he is manning an isolation centre in his panchayat and comforting migrant labourers and their family members.“It is encouraging to see how the Odisha government is using community leaders like Jagdish Thapa to sensitise the community on the dangers of COVID-19. Clearing misconceptions around the homecoming migrants, if not addressed wisely, can make the crisis acute,” said Neenu Thomas, Director of International Justice Mission, an NGO working on migration issues in Odisha.An uneasy calm prevails in villages across the State as 7.5 lakh migrant workers are likely to return after lockdown restrictions are lifted.

It is often found that absence of ventilator facility in district level government health institutions increases chances of fatality in snakebites,” said Dr. Mohapatra.Although snakebite was declared as a State-specific disaster in 2015, health infrastructure was not upgraded to deal with the threat.Snakebites have claimed 3,565 lives in Odisha in the past five years. In 2019-20 alone, as many as 723 persons died from snakebites. The year 2018-19 had worse numbers with 913 snakebite deaths.“Acute neuromuscular paralysis, a type of neurotoxicity, is caused due to bite of cobras and kraits. Mechanical ventilation, intensive care and anti-venom treatment with prolonged hospital stays are key to snakebite treatment,” said the ZSI scientist.Despite recording high snakebite deaths, the government had never added ventilator facilities as well as manpower trained in handling ventilators in government health centres below the sub-divisional level hospitals.Now, as part COVID-19 pandemic response, the State government has ramped up ventilator facilities in government healthcare institutions.“Prior to COVID-19 pandemic, we had 297 ventilators available in the State. Now, we have already added 57 while ventilator facilities have significantly improved in private sector,” said Bijay Mohapatra, State Director of Health Service.During past one month, the government has created 5,486 beds in 34 COVID-19 only hospitals. As many as 352 ICU beds are available. Many of these ICUs have ventilator facilities.As the monsoon is little over a month away, people in rural areas will become more vulnerable to snakebite.

Market price of an ‘aerosol box’ is around 10,000 rupees. But Berhampur ITI made it at low production cost of around 3000 rupees. Each ‘face shield’ is sold for around 200 rupees, while its production cost at Berhampur ITI is just 11 rupees.While the institute remains closed for students during lockdown, principal and staffs of Berhampur ITI designed and constructed them in the workshops of the institute. The ‘aerosol boxes’ and ‘face shields’ prepared by Berhampur ITI will be provided to COVID-19 hospital in Ganjam district. ‘Aerosol box’ is a transparent box with holes to enter gloved hands, which is put over the head of a COVID-19 patient placed on ventilator in ICU during the intubation process. Intubation involves insertion of endotracheal tube (ET) through the mouth to the airway. The ‘aerosol box’ serves as barrier to check possible transmission of COVID-19 droplets from the patient to the treating doctors administering intubation. The ‘aerosol box’ of Berhampur ITI uses 4mm transparent acrylic sheets that are cut by laser cutting machine to make the joints completely airtight, said Mr Panigrahy. After use for one patient it can be sanitised for reuse, he added.The ‘face shields’ of Behampur ITI uses A4 transparent shields with foam lined elastic bands to keep them attached to the head of the user. These shields covering face, eyes and neck are useful protective gear for medical staff, ambulance drivers, health workers and police, who are at high risk of airborne viral droplets. In comparison to the ones available in market, our ‘face shield’ is more comfortable and can be worn for long time, said Mr Panigrahy.Added to it, Berhampur ITI has also constructed one cost effective ‘mobile COVID-19 sample collection kiosk’ at cost of 30,000 rupees. Till now no COVID-19 positive case has emerged from Ganjam district. If need arises more such mobile kiosks will be constructed."

After zone-wise selected activities were allowed in the lockdown-3, the committee members discussed the issue of chariot construction at a meeting held through video-conferencing on Monday. Servitors had been insisting on holding the festival.State-wise tracker for COVID-19 cases, deaths and testing, and a map of confirmed cases in India“Chariot construction is ought to be taken up from Akshaya Tritiya which fell on April 26 this year. Due to lockdown, we could not commence the programme. We are already late by more than a week now. We do not want to delay it further. However, the State government is the final authority to take a call on the issue,” said Dibyasingh Deb, Puri’s titular king and Chairman of the Managing Committee.“Construction of chariot does not violate lockdown guidelines. Making chariot and holding the festival are two different things. Since Puri falls in green zone, construction of chariots can be taken up. Holding the rath yatra would depend on the unfolding pandemic situation during June,” said Mr. Deb.“Chariots are dismantled every year after the rath yatra and the wood is used as fuel wood in the grand kitchen of the temple. If we are unable to hold the rath yatra, the wood will be used in kitchen,” he said. "

1138,Odisha,"May 08, 2020 00:20 IST",Other States,BERHAMPUR,Coronavirus | Pandemic brings plight of Ganjam’s migrant workers to the fore,"Lakhs of migrant labourers from Odisha’s Ganjam district working in Gujarat’s Surat have suffered the scourge of diseases like plague and AIDS in the past, apart from the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. They have nevertheless faced grave odds to provide much-needed financial support to their families. Most of them work in Surat’s textile industries. Diminished statusIn 1994, the Surat plague outbreak compelled their exodus back to Ganjam. At the time, society here viewed them with suspicion and fear. Since the first HIV+ case was identified in Ganjam in 1996, migrant workers have also been associated with the incidence of AIDS in the district. Ganjam is the most HIV-prone region in Odisha and the majority of infected persons are migrant workers having a link to Surat. This further diminished their social status.At present, due to the COVID-19 threat, and the loss of jobs and incomes, they are returning to Ganjam in large numbers. Again, they are being branded as carriers of disease and looked down upon by their fellow villagers. A few of the workers, known to have links to crime, have travelled from Ganjam to Gujarat, or vice versa, to escape arrest, which has additionally made locals suspicious about them as a community.‘Inhuman conditions’Lokanath Mishra, convenor of ‘Link Workers’ Scheme’, a project for Odia migrant workers said, “Decline in income and economic status of these workers in Surat has also been a reason behind their loss of social status back home. Modern communication has enabled people in Ganjam know the inhuman living conditions of migrant workers in Surat.”Lack of employment opportunities near home forced more workers from Ganjam to travel to Surat in large numbers since 2004-05. This reduced the scope for the enhancement of their wages in Surat’s textile units. In 1993-94, a worker would earn ₹100 for making a hundred metres of cloth. In more than two decades, their wage has only doubled, which is a barely minimal increase, if continuing inflation is taken into account, said Mr. Mishra. Added to this, migrant workers have never had any job security, leave or a prescribed minimum wage. The days they would spend at home were always conflated with the loss of jobs and payments, also detrimental to their social status.Staying awayTutendra Sahu, a former migrant worker turned peer leader to link migrant workers to government schemes and HIV prevention projects said, “In Talasara panchayat of Kodala block, there are several migrant workers who have registered to return home for the first time after gap of over two years. Similarly, in Gangapur panchayat of Aska block several returned migrant workers had not preferred to return home for over a year. Most of them are unmarried, male migrants. There are very few females among the present Surat returnees.”Social organisation ARUNA estimates that around 6 lakh migrant workers of Ganjam district, most of them working in Surat, send approximately ₹2,000 crore to their families every year. Beguniapada-based social activist Pramod Kumar Jena said, “They manage to do this by minimising their [living] expenses to the extreme at their workplace.”Almost all of them are now in institutional quarantine to reduce the scope of contagion through them. So far, 21 persons have been tested positive for the novel coronavirus in Ganjam district. They have all returned from Surat and are in quarantine.“Most of them earn less than ₹15,000 per month but send around ₹1 lakh annually to families in Ganjam. Like [the Hindu deity] Neelakantha, they swallow their troubles,” said Mr. Sahu."

Sensing that the days ahead would only become grimmer, the migrant worker started his journey towards Odisha on April 14.“I was alone on the road with puffed and flattened rice and ₹2,000 for emergency.

Except a few words exchanged about their domicile, I did not have time to waste. I was able to cover a distance almost 100 km a day,” narrated Mr. Suna.When he reached his village, Khajurpada, fellow villagers did not allow him to enter his house. Mr. Suna was advised to stay at a panchayat quarantine centre in Pitalkhat, 12 km away. He was reluctant to spend another 14 days away from his family.“I opted for quarantine on the verandah of our village school and promised not to break the quarantine norms. At least, my parents and brother could watch me from a distance,” he said.

1144,Odisha,"May 10, 2020 18:41 IST",Other States,BHUBANESWAR,Coronavirus lockdown | Hopes run high as migrants return to western Odisha,"As a special train carrying 1,200 people pulled in at the Titlagarh Railway Station in Balangir district on Sunday, it raised hopes that other distressed migrant workers in poverty-stricken western Odisha would also return. Thousands of migrant workers from the region — comprising of Balangir, Kalahandi, Nuapada, Subaranpur and Bargarh districts — which is infamous for its poverty and distress migration, are stranded in different parts of the country.The arrival of the train from Mumbai to Titlagarh marked the first formal return of migrants from other States to the region. Workers from 21 of 30 different districts of Odisha got down at Titlagarh, from where about 50 buses took them in different directions after thermal screening at the station. However, these five districts are yet to receive their own native men and women.Paltry wagesEvery year, about 3 lakh people comprising women and children undertake migration to work in brick kilns and in the construction sector in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka at paltry wages.With little by way of financial reserves, these hapless people, mostly landless and marginal farmers, take wage advances through unscrupulous labour agents every year. Between October and December, they are trafficked to other States to repay the wage advance paid beforehand by the agents.“These labourers migrate in semi-bonded conditions due to lack of sustainable livelihood options in their native soil. This is further compounded because of exploitative practices of moneylenders who take advantage of this situation and charge high rates of interest,” said Umi Daniel, a noted migration expert, who has been studying distress migration for the past two decades.Although workers face physical and mental harassment in workplaces, they knowingly jump out of the frying pan into the fire, Mr. Daniel said, adding that the never-ending cycle of debt forces them to accept meagre advances before every annual migration.‘Not able to reach’ “We have failed our own people. Neither people’s representatives nor government officials have vociferously raised the plight of people who have migrated from the region. The oppressed labour force cannot fight for its own survival. We are getting innumerable calls from these people, but they are not able to reach the special trains leaving for Odisha,” said Prashant Kumar Nayak, who heads Palli Alok Pathagar, a Balangir-based social organisation. Sources said 93,860 migrant workers from Balangir district alone have registered with the government for return. In Titlagarh block, where the train reached, 7,563 persons are stranded outside. Mr. Nayak said that since families migrate to other States as labour units, they are more vulnerable than other workers. “The government must prepare a list prioritising the vulnerability of the stranded people. Distressed and voiceless migrant workers from western Odisha should not be left to die silent deaths,” he said.Calls for helpMeanwhile, family members of stranded migrant workers have sought government intervention for the return of their near and dear ones.“My daughter and son-in-law are working in a brick kiln near Visakhapatnam. They are desperate to return. The brick kiln owner is not allowing them to return. We are hearing that people are being brought back to Ganjam, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik’s home district. Why are such efforts not being made for western Odisha?” asked Bhagaban Bag, a native of Dahita village under Bargarh district. Similarly, in Belpara block of Balangir district, the ageing father and wife of Indrajit Putel, who works in a brick kiln in Chitoor district of Andhra Pradesh, have been begging for help for the return of Mr. Putel. Nothing, however, has materialised so far."

This was stated by the Union Minister for Skill Development Mahendra Nath Pandey in an interview to the AajTak TV news channel.

News of this device was published in The Hindu on May 7.‘Rising demand’According to Mr. Panigrahy, the Union Minister has directed around 13,000 ITIs in the country to carry carry this out. “This will surely be able to meet the rising demand for UV sanitiser chambers at COVID-19 hospitals and other medical institutions throughout the country,” Mr. Pandey said.In Berhampur, some local doctors have transformed discarded microwave ovens to UV sanitiser chambers with the support of the Berhampur ITI.ITI, IISER Berhampur join forces to manufacture hand sanitisersEarlier, staff of the Berhampur ITI also designed and manufactured nominally priced “face shields” and “aerosol boxes” to save frontline personnel from infections. This technique, too, was transferred to other ITIs elsewhere in Odisha and outside the State.

Two months later, he faces a daunting 1,000-km ride on a bicycle before he can hold his newborn son. He has already pedalled 750 km of the 1,800-odd km from Vijaywada in coastal Andhra Pradesh to his home in Gorakhpur in eastern Uttar Pradesh.With him on the long journey home is Hari Lal, also the father of three-month-old baby girl. Mr. Dev, Mr. Lal and two other men from U.P. had been engaged by a Hyderabad-based outsourcing company. Just before the lockdown was announced, they were sent to Vijaywada on an assignment. The four had ₹40,000 then, of which they already spent ₹10,000 on food over the past two months. “We cannot die before holding our babies in our arms. We managed with the little rations till now and could not stretch it further. Despite our formal registration with the U.P. government, no concrete assurance was communicated to us [on arrangements to travel back],” said Mr. Dev. Bought new cyclesUnable to bear the uncertainty, the group set out six days ago. Investing the last of their savings in four new bicycles at ₹5,000 each, the four charted their route from Vijayawada to Visakhapatnam, on to Bhubaneswar, Jamshedpur and finally Gorakhpur. The Hindu met them as they took a break at Bhubaneshwar on Monday.Luck favoured them in the first stage of the journey as three truckers gave them a lift for around 250 km. They have completed another 500 km on the cycles. “We hope to meet some more kind-hearted truckers for the remaining 1,000 km journey,” said Mr. Lal. But even as some volunteers organised food for them in the State capital, they faced hostility from locals given the stigma attached to outsiders due to the virus outbreak, forcing them to set off immediately for Jamshedpur.“Hunger and uncertainty are forcing people to take drastic steps. I have seen at least 25 groups either cycling or walking along NH-16 in the past one week,” said Kalyan Anand, a volunteer, who has been arranging food and some transport for such groups.Mr. Dev and his three friends were worried that they might be put in a quarantine centre as the Centre has asked States not to let anyone walk on the road or railway tracks.However, with getting a ticket home on the few Shramik Special trains posing quite a challenge and continued uncertainty on the work front, hundreds of desperate migrant workers continue to undertake long and perilous journeys home."

But, for Rajendra Dhinda, a worker from Odisha’s Balasore district, the journey back was nothing short of a struggle.Thanks to the double quarantine Mr. Dhinda and his co-migrants were subjected to, the homecoming keeps prolonging.Also read: Coronavirus lockdown | Weary migrant workers lug crashed hopes en route their homesFirst, the Andhra Pradesh government put them in a quarantine centre while they were travelling by road. They were again sent to quarantine in their village in Odisha from Tuesday.It took Mr. Dhinda 26 days to reach Raminga, his village in Balasore, on a bicycle from a granite factory near Ongole in Andhra Pradesh where he worked. Now, he has to undergo 21 days of quarantine at the panchayat as COVID-19 protocol of Odisha does not allow him to directly step into his home.Also read: Three migrant workers on way to Uttar Pradesh die on Maharashtra-Madhya Pradesh borderMr. Dhinda started his journey from Ongole on April 16. Around the same time, Manas Sahu, a hotel employee from Cuttack district, also set out for home from Kurnool. Propelled by the urge to reach home, Mr. Sahu and others had covered the first 300 km in three days. But, they could not evade the watchful eyes of the Rajahmundry city administration. They were sent to a quarantine centre on April 19.“It was a double whammy for us. Despite pleading with the Rajahmundry administration that we would have to anyway undergo quarantine at our village, officials did not pay any heed to us,” said Mr. Dhinda at Bhubaneswar, 230 km still away from his home, on Monday.After 17 days, on May 5 they were asked to go from the Rajahmundry centre. They reached their village, continuously pedalling for seven days.Sudarshan Bal, who was also cycling back to home in Odisha’s Keonjhar district from Ongole, had a similar tale to tell. All met in the Andhra Pradesh quarantine centre.‘Challenging journey’“There could be more than 50 Odias we had come across in the Rajahmundry quarantine centre. Many were on bicycles and a good number of people had started walking back home. The fear of covering the 1,000 km-long distance did not deter us from undertaking such a challenging journey,” they said.“As per our estimate, there could be around 3,000 Odias engaged in different granite factories near Ongole. The pandemic forced the factories to shut down their operation, leaving hundreds of workers jobless. Initially, owners had taken care of us well. As the lockdown was extended, the factory owners switched off their mobile phones,” said Mr. Bal.After leaving Rajahmundry, the migrant workers split into smaller groups to avoid the risk of facing quarantine again.Though the lockdown stress had undermined the COVID-19 fear among the migrants, panic held back the general public from extending help to those in distress.It was tragic that many migrant workers had begged for water while walking back under the scorching heat. “People shut the door on us and refused to come close. We were treated like coronavirus bombs. It really hurts us,” said Mr. Dhinda.When asked why people were not waiting for trains, service of which had resumed, they said inconsistencies in government promises had made people sceptic, forcing them to start their return journey on their own."

The drive met with resistance on its opening day on Monday at a school in Bharatpur district’s Nagar block where the parents of 600 students prevented the health officials from vaccinating the children.At least 15 children, who were administered the vaccine in Jhunjhunu district’s Kakoda village, were shifted to a hospital when they complained of vomitting and nausea. On Tuesday, half-a-dozen girls at Vaidik Kanya Vidyalaya in Jaipur were admitted to Sir Padampat Mother & Child Hospital when they felt dizzy after vaccination. They were kept under observation till late in the evening.‘Without consent’ While the Medical & Health Department maintained that the vaccination was voluntary, the local officials tried to convince the villagers of its benefits. Some parents alleged that the vaccination was being done without taking their consent and it would have an “adverse impact” on their future generations.Inaugurating the month-long campaign at Mahaveer Public School here, Medical & Health Minister Raghu Sharma said it would be the biggest vaccination drive in the world, as India accounted for 36% of deaths of the world’s children by measles.

Also read | PM Modi indicates a 14-day extension of nationwide lockdownThe activists also demanded a complete ban on sale, distribution and advertisement of tobacco products as a part of the efforts to control the pandemic.The State government has banned the spitting of betel leaf, any chewable tobacco or non-tobacco products or sputum in public places and institutions under the Rajasthan Epidemic Diseases Act, 1957. Any violation would invite penal action under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.Additional Chief Secretary (Medical & Health) Rohit Kumar Singh said it was necessary to place restrictions on the “unhealthy habits” of people.Groups that have undertaken a sustained campaign for tobacco control in the last four years said the ban on sale of tobacco and its products would not only help in containment of COVID-19 but would also strengthen the government’s ‘Nirogi Rajasthan’ campaign which was launched in December 2019 to create awareness of diseases and their prevention.Risk to tobacco usersJayesh Joshi, secretary of the Banswara-based VAAGDHARA, a non-governmental organisation, said the smokers and tobacco-users were at a higher risk of infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) has also warned of virus transmission from hand to mouth while smoking. The reduced lung capacity of smokers exposes them to serious illnesses.Mr. Joshi, who wrote a letter to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot before the ban on spitting was imposed, said the WHO had lauded the State government’s decision to regulate the sale and consumption of tobacco twice in the past. “It is high time the manufacture, sale and distribution of tobacco products were banned in Rajasthan. Several other States have imposed a similar ban on pan masala,” he said.Though the State government had authorised municipal bodies in 2018 to regulate the sale of tobacco products, the vendors violating the rules pay a petty fine and return to selling tobacco.

From 11 red zone districts on April 15, the State has decreased the number to eight, along with a reduction in the rigorous measures that had previously been undertaken to contain the spread of the virus. Read | One more COVID-19 death in Rajasthan; death toll rises to 90Various activist groups, working under the banner of Jan Prayas and headed by development economist Bina Agarwal from the University of Manchester, said here on Wednesday that the zonal colour approach would be ineffective because asymptomatic persons in a green zone could infect others and, in turn, the supply chains that ran across zones. “Industries should be allowed to open up in all zones, including red zones, as long as they have a starting pool of green workers,” they said.Kavita Srivastava, the Rajasthan president for the Peoples Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), said a memorandum with the recommendations had been sent to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot after a brief telephonic conversation with him. The experts said that industries with live-in workers must be monitored to ensure that the workers are provided with adequate shelter, food and water. Moreover, industries should be granted permission to operate only if they had paid their dues to the workers for the work done since the lockdown began on March 21 in the State.Highlighting the suggestions made by Ms. Agarwal, who has worked on livelihoods, property rights, poverty and inequality, the group said the State should reconsider quarantine guidelines, ensure food security and the workers’ safety. The State should also increase the number of antibody tests done to confirm if a worker was free from the infection, it added.Recovered COVID-19 patients should be given certificates in order to reduce societal discrimination against them, they said, adding that this would make it easier for them to reintegrate and be employable with minimal risk. Moreover, workers cleared in such a manner could constitute a pool of “green workers”, who could then be safely employed.The group also raised the issue of migrant workers, adding that their transport, food and water supply during the journey back to their States should be provided free of cost.Jan Prayas said the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGA) should be expanded to more than one family member till the next financial year and the minimum days of work should be increased to 180. A similar employment guarantee scheme for urban areas should also be initiated, they said.Recommending a change in quarantine guidelines, the experts said that the present procedure of an entire workforce being quarantined due to a single worker testing positive should be re-examined. “An alternative would be to shift the worker affected by the virus to a quarantine centre and allow the rest to continue working. But it should not be done for workers living at home, since that would put their families at risk,” the group said. The experts said that families not covered under the National Food Security Act should be given the same entitlement of cereals, pulses, oil and other essential items. Moreover, ragpickers, garbage collectors, sweepers and other frontline workers should be given masks and gloves for free. Contracts could also be given to self-help groups to make these items, it said.Groups represented in Jan Prayas include the Right to Information Manch, Centre for Equity Studies, Rajasthan Asangatith Mazdoor Union, Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan and Helping Hands Foundation."

Only the core members of the groom’s family came to Madurai.With the curfew beginning at 7 a.m. and with the movement of public transport vehicles being cancelled, the families decided to advance the ‘muhurtham’ for the convenience of the guests.The ‘muhurtham’ that was scheduled between 7.30 a.m. and 10.30 a.m. was advanced to 4 a.m.“We informed about the change in the ‘muhurtham’ timing to those who were in Madurai City. For the rest, we requested them to not take pains to make it to the marriage function. We told them that we will not feel bad about their absence,” said J. Sampath, 58, uncle of the groom.Masks and sanitisers Initially, the family members had planned to provide masks to all the guests and place sanitisers outside the hall as a precautionary measure.However, they could not manage to get both masks and the sanitisers.All that the family could do was consciously avoiding handshake. “Instead we welcomed people with the traditional folded hands,” he explained.With only few scores of guests turning up, the marriage was solemnised early in the morning.By 7.00 a.m. most of the guests had left for the hall after breakfast.“Only a very few close relatives of the bride and groom stayed back in the marriage hall. It was absolutely no disappointment for any of us. It is only a small contribution from our side to stop spreading COVID-19 by having a limited guests at the marriage,” said Mr. Sampath."

But the State government has operationalised another portal - http://tnepass.tnega.org - for obtaining e-passes.""In the system, ‘RETURN OF STRANDED PEOPLE’ has been added as the additional provision of issue of e-pass for movement of people within a district/within Tamil Nadu/Inter-State movement, apart from the earlier approved grounds (marriage, funeral and medical emergency),"" a G.O. issued in this regard on Tuesday said.""No movement of stranded persons shall be permitted without TN-ePass,"" the G.O. said. However, officials involved in facilitating the process were not on the same page over e-passes.While one officer said the Tamil Nadu government-issued pass was valid in the State through which the pass-holder was transiting, another said a separate pass had to be obtained from each State. “There is confusion because not all States are accepting a single system. While some States allow people to transit through them with a T.N. government-issued pass, others don't. We are trying to streamline it,” an official involved in the process said.Another issue facing the authorities is duplication of data. “Many have registered themselves multiple times. So, we have operationalised http://tnepass.tneda.org for e-passes,” an official said.Speaking to The Hindu, a person who left Tamil Nadu for Kerala on Tuesday said, “The confusion is due to the fact that different States use different systems. There is no uniformity; no single website where we can apply. There are multiple websites for applying for multiple options in different places. Unless a uniform system is put in place, confusion is bound to prevail.”Officials said the chances of getting an inter-State e-pass depended on the age and address of the applicant and whether the address fell under the red or orange zone in Tamil Nadu or any other State where the individual wished to go.“Unless it is an emergency, it is better to wait for some clarity. All States are confused over this process,” an officer said."

More tokens have been printed, based on the crowds seen on Thursday,” said a senior police officer.Besides, additional counters will be opened in Tasmac shops in the three districts depending on the rush. “If the crowd is more than 2,000, three counters will be opened and two counters if the crowd is around 1,000. On Friday, the crowd was better managed. The problem in the districts is that there are fewer shops are high demand,” added the officer.Protests by residentsResidents of Meyyur and Kelambakkam near Periyapalayam protested against people from other places coming to purchase alcohol from the Tasmac shop in their village.“On Thursday many people from Chennai had come to Tiruvallur to purchase alcohol. The residents are frightened that they may be infected. Hence when the shop opened on Friday, the residents protested demanding that outsiders not be allowed.

1206,Tamil Nadu,"March 25, 2020 20:01 IST",Chennai,Chennai,Special care for Chennai residents in the times of Corona,"In these times, residents may pointedly look in the direction of their Associations for guidance and leadership, and also some measures that will make the mundane aspects of life easier to handle. This scenario can be readily associated with gated communities, where, by dint of their very nature, this expectation is usually high, and bound to be higher now.So, when a neighbourhood association watches out for its residents in an unusual manner, it is more of a heartening thing. And in these times, such gestures can be quite a balm — residents of these two neighbourhoods can't agree more. Recently, the neighbourhood association at Vivekanandapuram First Street placed a bulk order for hand sanitizers — not a case of hoarding here — so that residents would be spared the trouble of making multiple trips to the pharmacy. The order is said to have been made for the benefit of all households in the neighbourhood. S. Murali, the Association's president, says “As we bought one hundred 500-ml sanitizers, we got a huge discount from the pharmacy.” While residents have to pay for the sanitizers, some sanitizers have been kept aside for free distribution to conservancy workers.Handy lists Annai Indira Nagar Residents Welfare Association in Velachery recently went to the trouble of finding out about the provision stores in the neighbourhood and its precincts, that are open (and have not shut down temporarily on account of the lockdown) and making a list of them. Similarly, a list of pharmacies that can be expected to be open till late in the day were also listed. These lists were then shared on the Association’s WhatsApp group to ensure residents don't have to beat around the neighbourhood looking for some essentials they may want. “Not all provision stores are opened now at Annai Indira Nagar. Therefore, we thought of sharing information about those stores that can be expected to be open. Pharmacies are indispensable, and so we also got list of them done. We have advised residents to keep the bills issued by the shops with them so that they can show it to the police as proof that they stepped out of home for an entirely valid reason,” says S. Kumararaja, an office-bearer of the Association."

1209,Tamil Nadu,"March 25, 2020 15:34 IST",Tamil Nadu,CHENNAI,COVID-19: Here’s what Tamil Nadu has been doing since January,"Tamil Nadu’s Directorate of Public Health set off measures to prevent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in mid-January. What has been the State’s strategy from then? Director of Public Health and Preventive Medicine K. Kolandaswamy has the answers. The State’s COVID-19 prevention and control measures revolve around three strategies. “The first strategy was to prevent the entry or delay the entry of the virus in the State, region and district. This was done through thermal and clinical screening of passengers travelling from affected countries. Hand sanitisation immediately after disembarking from aircrafts followed by home quarantine for 28 days, which is double the infection period. Persons with symptoms are being admitted to isolation wards in hospitals,” he said.The next strategy is to prevent the transmission of the infection. For this, the Directorate has been repeatedly insisting on respiratory hygiene: remaining at home if someone has a cough, sneezing and fever, and covering faces with handkerchiefs while coughing or sneezing, and washing hands with soap and water.“Surface hygiene is something that we have been stressing for a long time. It is important to disinfect areas frequently touched by hands such as door handles, handrails of staircases, escalators, seats, arm rests, table surfaces, lifts and ticket counters with disinfectant such as hydrochlorite solution,” he said.The third strategy is hospital and community preparedness. It is here that isolation rooms, personal protective equipment and protocol training for doctors and nurses comes in. “Each activity has its own value. Surface cleaning, respiratory hygiene practices and hand hygiene are the ultimate solution. Remember, complex problems have simple solutions,” he said.Dr. Kolandaswamy said that the second strategy was crucial to prevent person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. “Only Japan, Singapore and Tamil Nadu have been following this from the start. Unfortunately, many other countries rely only on the first and third strategies,” he said.Infection control, quarantine and treatment -- all three are crucial factors. “We have started massive disinfection measures using 1% hypochlorite solution. The Chennai Corporation, for instance, is engaging big vehicles to carry out infection-control measures in public places,” he said.A senior health official said while the clampdown would help in delaying a further spread of the virus to new areas and help prevent community spread, other measures such as respiratory hygiene, hand hygiene and disinfection of public places, transport and hospitals should be followed vigorously. “India has managed to delay the outbreak by more than two months. China did not curb COVID-19 with a clampdown alone. It took up massive disinfection from the third week of February that brought down the cases in March. So, a lockdown will help in delaying the spread. Japan and Singapore successfully controlled COVID-19 due to tracing of travel history and epidemiological links. They meticulously followed respiratory hygiene, handwashing and surface cleaning,” he said."

A Corporation official said that earlier many designated shops used to park their commodities along the pathway in front of their shops, thereby extending their shops and obstructing the movement of visitors.During weekends and holidays, “extensions” to shops, engineered through makeshift arrangements, would be a nuisance for visitors.In the past few days, such extensions have been cleared to disinfect the entire market complex as part of preventive measures against COVID-19. Further, Corporation officials said that only retail traders, who have their outlets in respective neighbourhoods, were allowed to make purchases in the wholesale market. Entry of people who may want to buy these items for their household is restricted to reduce the number of people gathered at the complex at any point of time.On an average, the wholesale market gets more than one lakh visitors every day especially during weekends and holidays, the Corporation officials said."

Is it the Director General of Police, Chief Minister or the Deputy Chief Minister?” is how he pounced on the State police.He said that the police could only book the violators of the Prohibitory Order promulgated under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code.“You can only advise them [to keep indoors]. Keep in mind that all [policemen] those assaulted [the violators] will lose your job if the video clipping is produced before High Court and Human Rights Commission,” he said. He also warned them of serious charges being booked against them.The advocate dared whether the police would take on the advocates, if they come out in violation of the curfew order. “The violators should only be produced before the magistrate. Let the magistrate decide on whether they could be let off on bail,” he said.Within few hours of this audio clipping did rounds on the social media, especially on WhatsApp, another clipping by an unidentified police person went viral. He said that the State police are aware of the penal sections and the advocate need not teach them on legal aspects.He took on the advocate saying every citizen, including the advocates, were bound by the curfew order and other laws. Anyone with the knowledge that his venturing out could lead to spreading of an epidemic can be booked.“You press any charge against us. You are free to even pack us home. It is not a problem at all,” the policeman said.

At one of the city hospitals, at least 50% of the staff that included laboratory technicians, conservancy workers and other hospital workers could not turn up for duty. “They were stopped by the police in several places. Though they displayed their ID cards, the police told some of them that there is no point in a lockdown if they move around like this. Our doctors and nurses were able to reach the hospital in the morning,” a senior doctor said. In the absence of many conservancy workers, the hospital had to make arrangements locally for cleaning measures, he added.

In the wake of coronavirus disease (COVID-19), some of these hospitals have given the tailors another task -- to stitch cloth masks for hospital personnel, both as a stop-gap measure and as an alternative to disposable masks.Though a senior doctor said cloth masks did not provide protection and have to be washed frequently, a cross-section of doctors in some of the hospitals, including those not directly involved in COVID-19 management, said the cloth masks came as an alternative as the disposable ones could be used when needed the most. “The hospital tailor, who usually stitches torn linen or patients’ gowns, is now stitching cloth masks for all of us. We have asked our staff to wear the masks, wash and reuse them. Almost all government hospitals have tailors, and we are utilising their services at this time. The number of masks made each day depends as per the demands, and are being used by many including doctors and nurses,” a senior doctor of a hospital said.He added that disposable masks were available, and these cloth masks were an alternative for all at the hospital. At another hospital, authorities said they had asked the hospital’s tailor to stitch cloth masks 15 days ago. “Usually, the tailor mends torn curtains and pillow covers. We have adequate stock of disposable masks and are using them judiciously. While we have provided the required masks and personal protective equipment for those directly involved in COVID-19 management, and medical and paramedical staff in outpatient departments, IMCU and TAEI wards, those working in other places of the hospital such as offices are using the cloth masks,” an authority said.Tailors were roped in to supply the required cloth masks at another hospital too. “We started to get the cloth required and stitch masks after realising the gravity of the situation. All our personnel wear these cloth masks. So far, we have got around 500 masks, and get about 60 to 100 per day,” a senior doctor said. Another senior doctor of a city hospital said cloth masks were not protective and need to be frequently washed. “Wearing masks gives a wrong sense of security.

1233,Tamil Nadu,"March 27, 2020 17:16 IST",Chennai,Chennai,COVID-19: Stay at home and reach out to the helpless,"While practising social distancing, one may have to be on the guard against getting distant from certain people’s struggles to have their essential needs met. Solve Ninja, a platform by social enterprise Reap Benefit, has started an initiative that marries social caring to social distancing.Through this programme, people can sit in the safety of their homes, and reach out to others by feeding in data that can be useful to them, even make a huge difference in their lives. On http://nd.solveninja.org, citizens across India can feed in information about people who may have certain critical needs that they struggle to meet during the shutdown, and also those who are likely to volunteer to meet those needs. Citizens can key in information about hospitals, testing centres and essential services providers, and this information will be there for everyone to view and use. On this platform, citizens can mention stores selling essential items that practise social distancing, and also call out those that don’t. Launched on March 26, the initiative already has citizens from Bengaluru, Chennai and Delhi feeding in data. “We did a test run in Shanti Nagar in Bengaluru where we pointed out shops that were not practising social distancing; the local residents’ welfare association’s attention was drawn to this, and we asked them to talk to the store managers about this issue,” says Kuldeep Dantewadia, co-founder, Reap Benefit. “We are trying to rely on the power of local people and their relationship with neighbourhood stores to make sure social distancing happens everywhere,” says Dantewadia. The same principle applies to mapping details of people who may need support in terms of food and other essentials. “When a resident or a member of an RWA feeds in details of a person in need that they know, the process of offering help becomes quicker,” he says. Dantewadia believes such efforts by citizens can hugely supplement the government’s work to help the needy. He then adds, “ Citizens can be a small workforce on behalf of the government.”"

They were enlarged on bail by judicial authorities after scrutinising the cases individually. These releases were necessitated following the orders of judicial magistrates or District Judges who visited the prisons and held special adalats. Most of the inmates who were released are suspects involved in petty offences. The Madurai Bench of Madras High Court has recently ordered all bail orders, anticipatory bail or parole should be extended till April 30. Director-General of Police and Inspector-General of Prisons Sunil Kumar Singh told The Hindu, “The congestion in prisons is considerably reduced now. At present, we have 52% occupancy of total capacity. The capacity is 23,392 and the occupancy is 12,166 as on date. We may bring this down to 50%.”Following recent orders of Supreme Court, a high-level committee headed by Justice Vineet Kothari, Judge of High Court, and Executive Chairman of State Legal Service Authority has directed the Principal District Judges of Chennai, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram to visit Central Prison, Puzhal, to assess further for granting bail. This direction is expected to bring down the number of inmates further.The prison department provided smart phones to prisoners to have video call with their family members and relatives.

The remaining beds are in various hospitals in Bengaluru and other districts, said Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education).He said there was no shortage of test kits and the Centre was providing the kits to labs in the State based on their requirement. “We have adequate stocks of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and masks for health professionals.

Despite the government making it clear that hospitals are not to turn away emergency cases, some are not attending to even those in advanced labour. Cases have been reported of patients from across the State running from pillar to post to get medical aid during emergencies. With COVID-19 being the main concern now, even an outbreak of cholera in Bengaluru did not get much attention. Shutters downWhile smaller private hospitals and clinics in some areas have downed shutters on their own, bigger hospitals have put up boards asking patients to visit only in cases of emergency. Some have even started video and telephonic consultations. On Thursday, the government permitted registered medical practitioners to provide tele-consultation to patients with minor ailments and those whose medical history is known to them.However, patients who need to see a doctor immediately for emergencies not related to COVID-19 are facing difficulties.Two days ago, a 20-year-old domestic help at Rajanakunte, who was in an advanced stage of pregnancy, had to run from one hospital to another in Yelahanka and surrounding areas seeking help.Chaya Bhatia, a resident of a gated community at Rajanakunte, who found the woman in total distress in front of a medical shop, said she had no baby movement and was in severe pain. The woman, who first went to a government hospital in Yelahanka, was asked to get an ultrasound scan done from outside. Nishant Bhatia, son of Ms. Bhatia, said, “After the scan, she was told that her baby was no more and that she had to undergo a procedure. However, as there was no doctor available on the day, she was asked to come at a later date, which is shocking.”Mr. Bhatia, with the help of some other residents of the gated community, got the woman admitted at a private polyclinic, where she underwent the procedure. “The lockdown is causing a lot of inconvenience to poor patients,” he said.Case in DandeliOn Monday, at Dandeli in Uttara Kannada district, the family of a 33-year-old woman, who was also in an advanced stage of labour, desperately tried to get her medical attention. “All private hospitals in Dandeli are closed and the staff at the general hospital refused to take responsibility. The family was asked to take her to Hubballi, which is 75 km away. They somehow managed to get her there,” said Mohammad Iqbal Shaikh, secretary of Anjuuman-e-Ahle Sunnat, an organisation in Dandeli.At Victoria Hospital, where the government has proposed to set up a dedicated COVID-19 facility, not just outpatients, even inpatients are finding it hard as they are being asked to get discharged as soon as they are stabilised.“If government hospitals refuse to attend to us on the ground that all doctors are busy with COVID-19 cases, where can we go?” asked Manjamma, who had brought her ailing daughter to Victoria Hospital earlier this week.S. Srinivas, State secretary of Indian Medical Association, said although hospitals have been asked not to turn away emergency cases, there may be some exceptions at some hospitals where the staff may not be able to get to work because of the lockdown, especially in rural and peripheral areas. “But emergencies such as pregnancies cannot be delayed. We will issue an advisory in this regard,” he said.‘Rectifying issues’Jawaid Akhtar, Additional Chief Secretary (Health and Family Welfare and Medical Education), said, “We are in the process of rectifying these issues. We have only said electives and non-essential cases can be deferred. If any specific cases of emergency refused are brought to our notice, we will initiate action against the hospital,” he said."

1244,Tamil Nadu,"March 28, 2020 17:07 IST",Chennai,India,Coronavirus: These NGO’s are working around lockdown restrictions to feed the needy,"Many of us, while checking our bank accounts and our stocked fridges this week, have felt a moment of gratitude for the economic security nets that we have, that will help us tide over the next 21 days. But there are also many who don’t have this net, and now do not have the option of stepping out to earn their daily wage. And so, some organisations are helping the fortunate former reach out to help the latter.For instance, Chennai-based Sumanasa Foundation has called for contributions to fulfil a target of ₹20,000, in order to provide 100 kilograms of rice, 50 kilograms of dal, 45 litres of oil, 15 kilograms of salt, jeera, turmeric and chilli powder for the city’s community kitchens, run by the Greater Chennai Corporation. Yuva (Youth for Unity and Voluntary Action), a non-profit in Mumbai, is fundraising online to provide daily needs to over 2,000 families they surveyed in the metropolis. They require funding not only for food and groceries, but also for volunteers’ safety gear.The NGO Safa, has been working with daily wagers like auto drivers, vendors and some members of the trans community of Hyderabad for 11 years now, and also have a presence in Chennai, Bengaluru, Mumbai and Delhi. Founder-president Rubina Nafees Fatima describes the situation in Hyderabad, “Even the night shelters, where we usually have difficulty convincing people — especially women — to move to, are seeing long queues of people hoping for food.” Safa has been providing a standardised package of rations “that can sustain a family of four for about five days” in the hotspots that they have located around the city.“We identify two people in each basti (hamlet) to volunteer giving out these packets at each door, so as to avoid queues. We have also trained our volunteers about hygiene and social distancing,” she says. Safa has been doing this for a few days now, but since the lockdown came into effect, supplies are expected to dry out soon. The main bottleneck is that of permits, both for people and vehicles. “We have vans and trucks with permits now, but need volunteer drivers. Wholesalers are also falling short of labour. Besides these, each city has its own unique problems,” she says, adding that the organisation is rolling out an app to coordinate with those who want to help.Similarly, Bengaluru-based NGO Hasiru Dala received permits for its vehicles and staff members only on Friday, says Lakshmi Karunakaran, a member of its children’s programme. “The challenges are multiple, because there is a complete freeze,” she says. “Before the lockdown, a relief work sticker on some of our vehicles would help them ply. Now, we need to give documents and the vehicle number in order to get a pass for each person on ground.” So even if more people are ready to volunteer, she explains, they have to wait till they get a pass, since movement in public is understandably under restriction.Pitch inSumanasa Foundation can be contacted via email at sumanasafoundation@gmail.com Safa can be reached through the volunteering app, buildtheworld.orgYuva can be found on its Instagram (@officialyuva) and Facebook (yuvaindia84) pagesThe NGO has been working with waste pickers in six towns and cities of Karnataka for 11 years now, including Bengaluru, Mysore and Hubli. “They pick recyclable paper and other things during the day, and sell them to scrap dealers at night — none of which they can do at the moment. Many of them are not from stable homes, or are migrants, or have no ration cards. We have identified about 2,000 families who don’t have ration cards, since they can’t avail the relief announced by the State Government,” says Lakshmi.Since the informal norms of social distancing began, they had begun distributing food kits and children’s hygiene kits (including soap and handkerchiefs). “Before the lockdown was announced, we had managed to give out 260 food kits, each containing five kilograms of toor dal, some masoor dal, oil, soaps, chilli powder and jaggery, in addition to 25 kilograms of regular rice, or boiled rice, or maize or wheat flour, depending on where the family had migrated from,” says Lakshmi, adding, “Since the lockdown, we have been running around for permission. But now that we have them, we can start work again.”"

In view of this, the District Mental Health Programme (DMHP) has issued a set of guidelines for medical officers and district psychiatrists to assess and treat persons seeking help.Officials said that persons addicted to alcohol are at risk of developing withdrawal symptoms following reduction or stoppage of alcohol consumption. They may experience bouts of depression or anxiety, mental and physical exhaustion, mood swings, irrational thoughts, unexplainable physical pain, irritability and sleeplessness, and there was an urgent need to treat them.“If left untreated, it could lead to a lot of complications. So, it should be treated properly, immediately and adequately, and this should be done by professionals. Some persons may go on forced abstinence. Some of them may develop complications such as delirium and psychotic symptoms, and some may not. The Institute of Mental Health is open round the clock with its counselling services, and tele-counselling is available at the district-level.,” an official said. The DMHP has written to the Directorate of Medical Education and Directorate of Medical and Rural Health Services to rope in medical officers working in primary health centres, district psychiatrists working in the district headquarters hospitals and under DMHP/faculty members in the departments of psychiatry in government medical colleges. They may be instructed to follow the guidelines furnished by the DMHP whenever any patient seeks their advice. Those in need of help can seek advice through the State health helpline at 104, or through telemedicine or contact the medical officers/district psychiatrists/faculty members of departments of psychiatry. The district-level health officials have been asked to publicise the contact details of these medical officers to enable the patients to contact them. Those who need treatment could be provided for their safe and consistent management of uncomplicated alcohol withdrawal. The guidelines for clinical assessment of patients with alcohol withdrawal symptoms includes a set of questions such as : What is your drinking pattern and has it changed, have you ever experienced blackouts, what do you experience when you stop drinking, when was your last drink, have you ever had delirium tremens, seizure or hallucinations, have you ever undergone detoxification treatment before, and how many times, do you have medical problems such as liver disease, pancreatitis or intestinal bleeding. The medical officers were also provided with Clinical Institute Withdrawal Assessment for Alcohol, a scale used to measure alcohol withdrawal symptoms to assess the patients, and provide medication as per the severity -- mild, moderate or severe alcohol dependence."

Authorities have specially purchased Smartphones for this purpose.Speaking to The Hindu, a senior prison official said the prisoners were visibly unhappy after the main gate of the prison was locked on March 17. “They began to have concerns about their family members, especially about aged parents and grandparents,” he said. Although the prison has a telephone booth, many longed for face-to-face interaction, he said adding, some began to worry that their families were lying about their well-being during phone conversations. So the authorities decided to buy two Smartphones on Wednesday and have put them for use by allowing the prisoners to talk to their family members on video calls. “We did not want to bother the government for more funds in these troubled times and used the money available for prisoners’ care,” the official said. The authorities fed the phone with listed and verified phone numbers of family members of the over 1,400 prisoners. An individual schedule for each prisoner had since been made. They would be allowed to use the video calling application for five minutes, thrice a week, the official said. The officials have also taken steps to ensure personal distancing and cleanliness at the prison by providing the prisoners with soaps and hand sanitisers. Meanwhile, some prisoners have also utilised the tailoring training they received earlier this year to make face masks. “We are selling them for ₹10 each. They will also be distributed to all police personnel. We’ve planned to make some for healthcare providers at hospitals,” he said."

More than 15 people formed a line under the scorching sun. A woman sub-inspector was in command. Standing before them she gave a demonstration on how to do half- squats. In the next 20 minutes, she took them to task by commanding them to repeat the half-squats.Jayanthi, a sub-inspector of police, said, “These people don’t understand the seriousness of a lockdown. They just saunter out without any purpose. Some of they say they came out from their houses to visit their friends or other such weak excuses. We have to effectively implement law and order by adopting these kinds of methods.”In Ennore Wimco Nagar, police caught people who were on the roads. They were made to do sit ups. While doing the squats, they repeated, “Hereafter, we will not roam anywhere. We will obey the orders of the government.”Another group in Maduvoyal police station were taken to task by police personnel. Here they repeated, “We will cooperate with the police and government authorities. We will wear masks,” while repeating the squats.Red Hills Inspector P. Jawahar has adopted yet another innovative way to make people follow the law. People were gathered together on roadside, they were asked to form three lines and were given the task of holding placards stating that they will obey prohibitory orders.Police personnel said to the violators, “You are all well-educated and should realise your mistake hereafter. You should go and tell people in the neighbourhood that people should not step out unnecessarily when a lockdown is in place and the disease may spread faster if people saunter out.”One man among the crowd recently returned from a foreign country and he was asked stay at home in quarantine. Police personnel warned him for coming out despite being in quarantine. One police personnel asked him, “Why you are coming out sir? You have been to foreign countries where you obeyed the law. But here, you don’t?. Sir you are educated and why did you come out, that too without any mask?” He was whisked away to the police station and a case was booked against him for violating the law.Assistant Commissioner, Flower Bazaar, Lakshmanan has another method to handle violators. He made them read out an undertaking under the scorching sun, stating that they would not come out unnecessarily hereafter during the lockdown period."

Sekar, president of the Federation of Cable TV Association of Tamil Nadu, told The Hindu that local cable operators might find it difficult to collect their monthly rent from customers in view of the lockdown and the restrictions imposed on movement on people.“Many of us will feel the heat. Recovery of monthly subscription from our customers might happen only after two to three months which will make life difficult for a lage number of operators. We cannot go out to address any breakdowns or line cuts or service issues as people have been advised to not allow visitors as well. Apart from this, people have been mandated to work from home, which means that if they face any issues in cable service or their Internet which a large number of cable operators provide, we are unable to attend to them, as we have not been given passes,” Mr. Sekar said.Mr. Sekar has also written to Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary K. Shanmugam seeking a direction to issue staff of cable tv operators with passes so that they will be able to address any issues faced by their subscribers during the lockdown.In the letter, he said that many of the cable operators also provide internet services through various service providers and since internet has been notified as an essential service, he sought a direction to be issued to district collectors to provide them with passes. “The government is also in the cable TV business. They need to address our concerns,” he told The Hindu.P. Sakilan, who runs TCCL, too said they were unsure of collecting the subscription from their customers. “Collecting rent is the biggest problem. We don’t know how to manage this situation as from April 1st week we have to collect rent. We are now thinking of collecting it via online mode,” he said.Mr. Sakilan said if broadcasters ask for payments in this situation, many MSO’s will find it hard. “Broadcasters will ask for payments and we are automatically billed,” he said and said MIB and TRAI should immediately issue guidelines for encryption-free service for two months.Mr. Sekar has also written to MIB and TRAI seeking a direction to broadcasters to provide pay channels free of cost till the outbreak subsides, taking into consideration the welfare of cable TV operators and consumers."

Arunodayam, a 27-year-old organisation based in Royapuram, which predominantly works with children in north Chennai has formed a WhatsApp group to reach out to them. “Through this group, we educate children about COVID –19. Here, we encourage them to sing songs and come up with shorts skits about the contagion, sitting in the safety of their home, and share their creative work on their WhatsApp group.

1274,Tamil Nadu,"March 25, 2020 01:33 IST",Tamil Nadu,India,To transplant or not: a COVID-19 question,"The COVID-19 pandemic poses special challenges to patients with organ failure. Those waiting for transplant or who had received a transplant tend to have more severe disease due to weak immunity. Patients with severe heart, lung, or liver failure and waiting for transplant are at a high risk for dying if a transplant does not happen within a short period of time. But if there are clusters of COVID-19 disease in the region around the hospital or if there are COVID-19 patients already admitted in the hospital then, the course ahead becomes a quandry.Performing a transplant surgery in such situation will increase the risk of exposure to the recipient during the surgery and in the recovery period. This exposure could happen from the donor or healthcare providers or other patients in the hospital. It is possible that the hospital resources could become limited due to COVID-19 cases and the care of the transplant recipients may get compromised.Non-urgent transplant surgeries such as kidney transplants in relatively stable patients on dialysis may be avoided in areas of high prevalence of COVID-19. If the recipient is critically ill and the surgery is unavoidable then care must be taken to check both the donor and the recipient for COVID-19 prior to transplant.Elective living donation transplants could continue in regions with low incidence and in hospitals with no infected patients. Deceased donation can continue in countries/regions with low incidence of COVID-19 but with stringent precautions.Currently, there is no evidence to support blood-transfusion related transmission of the virus particles and no additional precautions need to be taken by the blood bank during transplant surgeries. But voluntary blood donation may decrease and hence available blood must be used judiciously.All brain dead donors should be adequately screened for recent travel and potential exposure to virus. Deceased donation involves significant amount of interaction with the donor family, and increased human movement in hospital. Transplant coordinators should follow appropriate preventive measures to avoid exposure during evaluation. Donors with active infection or exposure to COVID-19 should not be considered for transplantation. Organ transportation throws additional challenges. Also deceased organ donation from hospitals with COVID-19 patients should be avoided due to risk of cross contamination.Regular visits to the doctor should be limited during this period of virus spread. Physicians can use telemedicine to reduce visits but continue interacting with the patient. Routine investigations should be limited and any elective procedures must be postponed. Dialysis patients and their treating physician should identify another small volume unit for dialysis needs if the situation arises where the primary centre is overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.The role of pre-emptive placement of AV fistula should be evaluated in patients with advanced renal failure to avoid the occurrence of emergent needs during COVID-19 epidemic. Transplant recipients with mild symptoms including runny nose, cough, throat pain and low-grade fever should be considered as suspected case of COVID- 19. They should be asked to self-quarantine themselves at home and consideration must be given to lower the immunosuppression. A majority of mild illnesses resolve spontaneously, with time and rest. However, such patients should be asked to closely monitor their symptoms. Patients with severe symptoms such as breathing difficulty, high fever and lack of oxygen should be admitted to the hospital. Immunosuppressive therapy should be discontinued or reduced in patients with severe illnesses. Currently, there are no proven therapies to cure coronavirus infection. The treatment in the hospital includes oxygen and organ supportive care until the lung injury resolves. Certain anti viral medication have been used on experimental basis with some reported benefits."

The names with contact particulars were sent to the respective city/district in the State asking police/health officials to check the health status of the passengers and their family members. “The immigration authorities have the details of passengers who arrived from foreign countries. We will make sure that these passengers who were advised isolation or home quarantine adhere to the health advisory. A special team will closely monitor their location and health condition. The geo-fence facility will alert us if the quarantined people move out of the designated place of isolation,” Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar said.He said prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Criminal Procedure Code would certainly help in breaking the chain of Corona virus spread in the community. Asked about senior citizens living alone, the Minister said all District Collectors were advised to do the needful to the elderly calling district helpline numbers for any assistance. The app that can be downloaded on iOS and Android is part of a comprehensive technology solution mooted by a young IPS officer R. Rohith Nathan, Superintendent of Police, Sivaganga, and his wife Dr. Kaveri Subbiah, a paediatrician, to the Government of India last fortnight. The model was designed to track people who came in contact with those infected or having severe symptoms of COVID-19.Though the plan includes analysis of the digital footprints of confirmed or suspected patients by perusing call details, tower locations to shortlist those who came in close contact with them, the State initially plans to launch geo-fence to control the spread of the virus and protect the uninfected population. There would be a feature for health officials to make a video call to a particular patient to check his/her health status live and prescribe medicines accordingly, official sources said."

Each block has eight floors and there are around 24 houses in each floor in the old tenements and 12 houses in the new ones. Most of the residents are daily wage earners. “This means, if one person gets infected, it won’t take much time for the remaining families to fall sick. Hence precautionary measures have to be taken,” says S. Dhanalakshmi, a resident of the tenement.The residents welfare associations in the colony have themselves put up boards near elevators asking only two people to travel at a time. “Initially we switched off the elevator, but many living on the seventh floor were finding it hard. So we are now allowing only two persons,” said a resident of L Block.Besides, the associations are also helping individuals, who do not have families living in their block, by providing them with food. “We also pour turmeric water to disinfect the corridor. Most of the residents are not stepping out,” said a resident of C Block.D. Karthikeyan, managing director, TNSCB, said that they are disinfecting 1.5 lakh tenements in over 300 places across the State. The board has purchased 91 spraying machines for 18 divisions in Chennai and other towns.“The corridors, staircase, lift, doors and insides of the blocks are sprayed with disinfectants using power sprayers. The exterior areas such as roads, platforms, shops and parks are disinfected with bleaching powder solution using jet-rodding machines on alternate days,” he said.Senior TNSCB officials are inspecting the colonies frequently. “We also have a jeep in the colonies to rush the residents who show symptoms to hospital.

Before the lockdown, on an average, nearly 1 lakh visitors, including retail traders used to visit the market every day. After the lockdown, the number of visitors to has dropped to 50,000- 60,000 daily.A few days ago, Health Minister C. Vijayabaskar inspected the market and checked the feasibility of deploying a health team to help in COVID-19 containment measures. Health teams were posted on a shift basis -- from 2 a.m. to 2 p.m. -- at two gates of the vegetable and fruit market.Health officials said the teams were deployed at the market to screen visitors, conduct medical camps and take up disinfection measures. However, the continuous inflow of customers is making screening difficult, an official source said. “The screening team has four to five handheld thermometers to check the visitors, and it is impossible to isolate those with symptoms considering the surroundings and crowd. Thermal scanners at the entry points will help the teams identify persons with fever,” he said.The wholesale traders start to come into the market from 1 a.m. onwards, while the retail markets open at 3.30 a.m. to 4 a.m. The market is open to the public till 2 p.m. “The teams are able to screen other State truck drivers and workers involved in unloading workers, and truck drivers from other parts of the State too,” he said. Traders noted that screening of visitors began on Wednesday morning at the important gates of the market. Though physical distancing is insisted on, it is not implemented as crowds surge during the few hours when the wholesale market functions, they said. S. Srinivasan, president, Chennai Fruits Agents Association, said drones were being used to disinfect the market. The market is receiving only up to 400 vehicles daily as there is a dearth of workers. However, the authorities must take action to control retail trading in some pockets of the market, he added. Officials of the Koyambedu Market Management Committee said the market was still crowded during peak hours and physical distancing is proving to a challenge. About 1,600 smaller vehicles that visit the market are regulated and disinfected, they said.“Health Department officials have sought the support of traders’ association for thermal screening in the market. We are using drones, jetrodding machines and lorries for disinfection,” an official said."

S. Arumugam, owner-and-shopkeeper of Sri Narasimha Stores, a grocery shop of remarkably small dimensions that he runs in a front portion at his house on Loco Works Road, decided on this innovation when a routine police patrol team exhorted him to check overcrowding of buyers at his shop. He placed the two flex boards, one huge and the other small, in cross-cross fashion in front of his shop thereby making the entrance to the shop so narrow that only one person can shop at a time. A notice has been put up on one of the boards telling shoppers that only one person can shop at a time. “It is a non-confrontational way of ensuring social distancing is practised. We can’t keep on asking shoppers to maintain social distance. Many people are likely get petulant, and it can get tiresome for me to keep repeating the instruction,” says Arumugam. Besides, Loco Works Road is an extremely narrow road, and he had to come up with a solution so striking to ensure people don’t swarm close to the counter.“As this grocery shop is centrally located, right in the middle of a densely populated residential area, many residents from streets in the neighbourhood can quickly access it, and so it is much-visited. Given this, it is necessary to have something like this,” says K. Sawarathi, a resident of Perambur. Interestingly, this grocery shop on Loco Works Road is one of very few shops of its kind along the railway lines from Perambur railway station to Perambur Carriage and Loco Works railway stations."

Similarly, there are groups that watch out for the differently-abled (but many of these are localised in their operations). Voluntary organisations working for the welfare of the visually-impaired, Nethrodaya in Mogappair and All-India Blind Progressive Association in Mandaveli, are helping out underprivileged visually-impaired persons by distributing bags of essential groceries to them. Despite these initiatives and resources to turn to, many a time things don’t work out smoothly. Resident of West Mambalam S. Balambal (54) who is visually-impaired, recently placed an order for can water, and was told by the shopkeeper that she would have to come and get the can herself, as delivery boys weren’t around. Now, to get around these practical problems, she has temporarily moved to her relative’s house.  J. Annapoorani, a resident of East Tambaram, narrates the ordeal of locating a new grocery shop as the one she visits regularly was closed. “People were a bit hesitant to offer me help in identifying the items in the racks.

Rajaa claimed that his efforts to set up a similar tunnel at the Mannargudi Municipality limits has not been received well by the authorities.“I did inform the authorities already about my intention and when I reached the Municipality office on Sunday along with the technicians for setting up the tunnel at the place to be identified by the civic body officials I found myself at a dead-end. I was told that the Commissioner (in-charge) and Municipal Engineer, R. Thirumalaivasan had gone on leave and hence I could not complete the task”, he said. The MLA managed to convince the municipal staff to take possession of the materials and install at the place they identify later.Enquiries reveal that on Monday, the tunnel sponsored by the MLA was installed along with the similar facility set up by the Municipality at the entrance to the temporary vegetable market functioning at the Mannargudi bus stand and these facilities were inspected by the Food Minister, sources said.Sanitisers donatedThe Mannargudi Town Unit of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has donated 50 bottles of sanitizers to the Government District Headquarters hospital, Mannargudi on Monday. The sanitiser bottles, worth ₹25,000, was handed over to the Medical Superintendent R. Vijayakumar by the CPI(M) Mannargudi Town Secretary, S. Arumugam."

The village’s two entrances have been barricaded with at least three men on guard at all times. Speaking to The Hindu, Vinoth Ganesan, who works as a junior assistant in a clinic in Chennai spearheaded the initiative and mobilised 30 others. “Our villagers are mostly farmers and daily wage labourers so the need to go out is not too much. However, people come to purchase produce, such as onions, and we are trying to control that,” Mr. Vinoth said. The youth are also armed with spray guns and hand sanitisers to ensure that the vehicles leaving and entering the village are disinfected. Village panchayat president S. Sridhar purchased the sanitisers and disinfectants. “Although the villagers and local policemen support our initiative, those entering the village do not take it well when we do not allow them in. They say we have no right to do so and that they will complain to the police. Some do not even want to tell us the reason for entering the village,” Mr. Vinoth said. “We first stop the vehicle and ask why they have come. If it is an emergency, we allow them,” he said. While the vehicle is sprayed with disinfectants, a volunteer gives the visitor hand sanitisers. For those who are not satisfied, a pot of turmeric water has also been kept."

Officials said that staff and visitors are allowed to go through the ‘tunnel’ one by one after ensuring that there was enough physical distancing between them.“The tunnel is an effort to prevent spread of COVID-19. The solution used to spray is 1% of sodium hypochlorite in 1 ppm and it has been tested and reviewed by a team of doctors. This has been in use in Tiruppur since a couple of days ago,” said District Collector A.

1312,Tamil Nadu,"April 06, 2020 17:09 IST",Tamil Nadu,CHENNAI,"COVID-19: Contact tracing, a crucial exercise","Every time a person tests positive for coronavirus disease (COVID-19), a process for tracing his/her contacts is activated. Exclusive teams at the State and district-level trace the path that the patient took, tracking persons with whom he/she came into contact, before testing positive. Till now, officials have tracked approximately 7,000 close contacts of patients who have tested positive for COVID-19, in Tamil Nadu. There are many others -- primarily low risk contacts -- who have also been tracked down. Contact tracing is not an easy job, but is a crucial exercise. Tracking contacts of patients is essential -- to identify those who were exposed to the disease and manage them, restrict their movement and prevent further transmission, officials said.“It is a meticulously done exercise otherwise we would not have been able to track and follow-up so many contacts,” a health official said. In Tamil Nadu, some of the major departments involved in contact tracing are the Directorate of Public Health, Home Department, the police and local bodies. With teams at the State and district-level, they rewind the movement of each patient -- places visited, mode of transport used and persons he/she came in contact with. Officials said they ask the individual or their close family member for details on travel history -- whether they travelled by flight or train, their recent places of visits including clinics and hospitals. The appropriate authorities -- airports, railways or app-based ride-hailing services are contacted directly for information. Consider this: if patient ‘A’ had tested positive (prior to the lockdown), he/she could have travelled by public transport at a particular time, or taken an autorickshaw from a stand or on the move, or an app-based ride-hailing service or visited a market or the beach. If the person had travelled by train or flight, the details with the exact seat numbers have to be provided by the Southern Railway or Airports Authority of India. The teams gather information of contacts by also collecting CCTV footage from places the patient visited if the surveillance facility is available. They track movement using mobile phone signals, an official said.“The critical point is when patient ‘A’ started to develop symptoms. We should take this into consideration -- there is the possibility of a patient transmitting the disease in the pre-symptomatic period too,” an official said. Sometimes, the close contacts are not ready to get identified and mobile phones may be switched off. “Routinely, around 200 to 300 persons are traced for a patient. But the crux is not tracking a big number but the right number of persons. Again, this may not be the case for all. Some patients will have a smaller track, they would have gone home from the airport in their personal car, did not visit any place and approached a hospital on developing symptoms. We have had less than 10 contacts for such persons too,” he added. Officials call for greater cooperation from the public. “Contact tracing is done for the welfare of the people. Initially there was mild resistance but now, people have started to cooperate. District teams have a major role to play as they interact and identify more since they have direct one-to-one conversations,” another official said.Whoever is in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient or those suspected to have symptoms, should be in strict home quarantine. If they have any symptoms of cough, fever and breathing difficulty, they can contact the local hospital or toll free number for any help -- 104, officials said."

Each zone has more than one lakh households. This is primarily because residents are unwilling to share details with Corporation workers who come to check on their condition,” said an official. More than 12,000 workers have started visiting houses to get information on residents with COVID-19 symptoms. One worker will collect data from 100 buildings in a day.

Traders said the reason for increase was a shortage in supply of goods due to lack of proper logistics.S. Bhaskar of Ganapathy Stores in Thoraipakkam said that items from other States such as Gujarat and Karnataka were not available, making them dearer. “We usually get tamarind from Tumkur in Karnataka and rava (sooji) from Gujarat. The prices of both these items have gone up. They are available in the wholesale market in limited quantities. We are unable to make our regular trip to Parry's due to police restrictions and don't do home deliveries either,” he said. Apart from the increase in prices, many goods have just vanished off the shelves.Tambaram resident Madhavan Venkatesan said it was very difficult for him to get biscuits, soap and liquid hand wash. “I can understand the lack of hand sanitisers in this situation. But even biscuits and snack items are not to be found. And when children are at home they demand snacks,” he said.M.

I waited for four days till my shop could get some. But by that time, the price had increased by ₹5 per kilo. When middle class families cannot keep our expenses under any budget in this situation, I wonder what the poor will do,” he said.

The sudden closure of Tasmac outlets across the State prompted the District Mental Health Programme to issue guidelines for doctors to assess and treat persons, who are addicted to alcohol and who seek help for withdrawal symptoms. Now, there is a steady flow of persons with withdrawal symptoms. At the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), the outpatient department has been seeing a minimum of three new patients with withdrawal symptoms every day. “We usually get patients with withdrawal symptoms. Now, the number of patients is more despite the lockdown and lack of public transportation. They come in with complaints of tremors, headaches, restlessness, nausea and vomiting. Many of them have moderate and severe withdrawal symptoms,” a doctor said.Lakshmi Vijayakumar, a psychiatrist who has been managing the de-addiction centre at Voluntary Health Services, said, “We are seeing quite a number of people with withdrawal issues. There are persons who have experienced seizures and psychological symptoms such as visual and auditory hallucinations. There are persons with underlying psychological disorders with alcohol use disorder (AUD). Co-morbidity is common in AUD. Some have mood disorders. We are seeing a high number of such patients too.”In addition, they were also receiving cases of domestic violence associated with withdrawal symptoms, she said. Most of the patients, she said, are from the low and lower-middle sections of the society. “Initially, those with withdrawal symptoms require medical treatment. Some will experience tremors, difficulty in eating that could last for four to five days. They will also experience inability to sleep and need to seek medical help. We need to provide hydration. They will need IV fluids and sedatives. Those absolutely addicted to alcohol - AUD - require detoxification for the first three to four days that can be followed by counselling,” she said.R. Thara, vice chairman of Schizophrenia Research Foundation, said they have had family members of persons experiencing withdrawal symptoms approaching them with queries. “There are persons with symptoms ranging from mild to severe. In fact, there is an economic dimension too, as they are trying to buy alcohol sold at exorbitant prices in the black market. This has led to an economic drain in the families. In future, these aspects should be taken into account and closure should be in a staggered manner,” she said. IMH doctors said many persons were unaware that treatment was available for withdrawal symptoms. “If needed, they can get admitted. We are also informing their family members that care should be taken to ensure there is no alcohol relapse after the lockdown is lifted,” a doctor said."

1324,Tamil Nadu,"April 07, 2020 09:23 IST",Chennai,India,COVID-19: Students with vision impairment shift to new platform,"It is a quarter past six in the evening, and A.R. Vasudha’s students are clutching their mobile phones. As the first lesson of the day, Vasudha plays them an audio clip from an English commercial and asks them to make a mental note of the unfamiliar words they come across. “Ma’am, can you repeat the clip?” a voice pipes up. This seems to be a trigger opening a flood-gate of similar requests from other students.It is a distance learning programme, and all the 10 students are visually-challenged, and they have logged into the virtual classroom through their mobile devices. With some prodding, Vasudha makes the class participatory — some students mention the words they are hearing for the first time. The participants are under-graduate students and they are beneficiaries of learning initiatives from Help the Blind Foundation (HTBF), a non-governmental organisation focussed on offering university education for the visually impaired.HTBF started offering employability classes, five days a week, in English and Computer Science in mid-March. Previously, these classes were offered on campus after college hours.Now, teacher-volunteers offer lessons, correct homework and give feedback on WhatsApp and some also offer one-to-one classes.Nataraj Sankaran, a trustee, says around 500 students from 17 colleges from Indian cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Coimbatore, Varnasi, Indore and Bangalore are enrolled with them.“We had 250 students attending our on campus classes, but since the lockdown, the number and enthusiasm has increased,” says Sankaran.They also have an increased number of volunteers, largely faculty from colleges, helping them in creating audio classes or modifying the curriculum. Some are reading paragraphs and sending them as audio files. Vasudha, who is an English faculty at St. Anne’s College in Bengaluru, says she finds her students more proactive in their learning engagement on the new platform. “Recently, I gave them a task where they had to be a reporter after listening to a COVID-19 related news. I was surprised to see that even students who are usually reticent, took part in the exercise,” she says. Tweaking the curriculum HTBF had to effect changes in its curriculum to make it online-friendly; even the trainers had to be reoriented. Stepping in as their knowledge partner, Enable India facilitated this process.Teaching computer science was a challenge. “Some of our students have not even touched a keyboard, so the challenge was huge,” says Sankaran. So, visualisation techniques had to be adopted. Example: to visualise a keyboard they had to imagine a rectangular object at home like a cutting board. So, they onboarded some visually-impaired teachers to teach these students, he says.There were other barriers. “For those who could not afford a phone, we provided the recharged option so that they could borrow their neighbour’s phone,” says Sankaran. Adaptation time The lockdown period presents an opportunity to adapt to new learning modes. HTBF plans to continue this distance learning programme until May. “ We plan to engage students on weekends even after the college reopens,” he says."

The city has also seen a drop in number of drunken driving cases as Tasmac shops have been shut down. However activists want the police to be prepared to handle the traffic once curfew is lifted.According to statistics provided by the Chennai Traffic Police, there have been seven fatal accidents between March 24 and April 5 and seven people died in these accidents. A total of 36 non-fatal accidents were reported during the same period and 43 persons were injured.However, between March 15 and March 24, there were 26 fatal accidents in which 27 persons died. Besides, there were 124 non-fatal accidents that were registered and 147 persons were injured. Police said that there were only one or two accidents per day now. Earlier, on an average, 25 major and minor accidents per day used to be reported, the police claim.“Since the lockdown period began, vehicle movement has been restricted. We also have check posts in 146 places across the city. Hence the accidents have reduced considerably. But a few continue to take place,” said A. Arun, Additional Commissioner of Police, Traffic.Besides, since all Tasmac shops and bars have been shutdown, drunken driving cases have also come down. “We used to conduct drunken driving checks on weekends and used to register close to 100 cases. Now there are fewer cases being reported, despite us continuing the checks,” said a police officer.During the initial days of the lockdown, there were a few incidents of youngsters indulging in rash driving. “However we intensified checking across the city and started seizing vehicles of those who are roaming around unnecessarily. Slowly such incidents also reduced,” added the officer.Activists said there will be major congestion on city roads once the lockdown is lifted. They want police to be prepared for a sudden increase in number of vehicles on the road. Besides, they want the police to increase vigil on roads using CCTV to check rash driving.M.

1330,Tamil Nadu,"April 07, 2020 15:33 IST",Madurai,Madurai,COVID-19 lockdown | Drop in number of cases at Madurai veterinary polyclinic,"The number of animals attended to by doctors at the veterinary polyclinic in Madurai district has dropped from around 150 to 200 a day in the last week of February to between 50 and 70 during the COVID-19 lockdown. Regional Joint Director of Animal Husbandry Department, D. Suresh Christopher said that prior to the district borders being closed due to COVID-19, people from neighbouring districts including Sivaganga, Ramanathapuram, Theni, Dindigul and Virudhunagar would often bring animals from cats to cattle to their polyclinic in case of emergencies. Earlier, the number of emergency cases would be a minimum of 15 each day. That has reduced to around five cases. “Usually, we would deal with a lot of complications that arise in animals during the process of giving birth. Although such cases continue to be a regular feature, there has been a drop since people who usually travelled long distances to access the doctors here until February have stopped coming,” he said. The number of outpatient cases too have drastically reduced to around two patients arriving each day. This is a deflection from the usual number of around 15. All elective surgeries which are not life threatening have been postponed and mass vaccinations for cattle too have been stopped, the Joint Director said. The polyclinic is now functioning with a full strength of doctors but only few paramedics because of the lack of public transportation. “Many people find it difficult to travel as they come from faraway places. We have been able to manage all cases as of now. However, the doctors who are managing dispensaries in 96 locations across the district should be lauded as they are struggling but still attending to cases,” he said. Food for straysApart from this, the Animal Husbandry department on the instructions of District Collector T. G. Vinay, have been distributing around 500 kg of rice with lentils and curd for strays on the streets via a network of animal volunteers. Mr. Vinay told The Hindu that it was essential to care for all life forms during this time of distress as most would not have any access to food. “Usually, strays often eat scraps and waste in bins and outside hotels. When we got calls from volunteers during the first two days of the lockdown regarding most strays starving, we decided to take matters into our own hands,” he said. He added that all volunteers had received special passes to continue their voluntary work across the district and said that more people can come forward to join this initiative.Dr. Suresh Christopher said that rice was being distributed daily to volunteers who could come and replenish their stocks to feed dogs in their areas. Elaborating on the presence of COVID-19 in animals, the doctor said that there has not been any unusual spike in the number of cases regarding respiratory illnesses in the district. “As a pet owner myself, I request people not to panic and abandon their pets. There have been no cases in Madurai regarding transmission to pets. They will not be able to survive on the streets by themselves and it would be an inhuman thing to do,” he said."

But the bigger boats have been deemed to have joined the annual fishing ban,” the official said.However, Durai Mahendran of Pulicat said the district administration needs to ensure availability of transportation for small fish vendors. “Other supporting infrastructure, including ice factories, need to function if we are to go fishing. A section of fishers is also apprehensive that sale of fish would attract crowds and thereby spread the coronavirus. The government should ensure the safety of all stakeholders,” he said.

Vinay has proposed to take over the entire Divisional Railway Hospital here and convert it into a dedicated COVID-19 treatment facility as per a Directorate General of Health Services notification. Divisional Railway Manager V.R. Lenin has sought the approval of Southern Railway headquarters on the issue, according to railway sources.Mr. Vinay, who is also the Chairman of District Disaster Management Authority, said this move was one of the several measures being taken to contain the spread and break the chain of transmission of COVID-19 infection. “As per the guidelines of the Centre and State governments, we have to isolate all suspected and confirmed COVID-19 patients. We plan to take over the entire railway hospital and convert it into a dedicated COVID-19 health centre,” he said in a letter to the DRM.In the letter, a copy of which is available with The Hindu, the Collector has asked the DRM to hand over the 115-bed hospital with its existing infrastructure and manpower – doctors, staff nurses, pharmacists, lab technicians, paramedical and clerical staff and workers. With 21 doctors on its roll, the hospital has three operation theatres and four-bedded intensive care facility. According to a railway source, the hospital registers an average of 60% occupancy.The district administration has requested that all available drugs and consumables, all logistics and equipment (instruments for patients’ care) should also be handed over. Meanwhile, National Federation of Indian Railwaymen has objected to the proposal of handing over the railway hospital to the district administration.In its communication to the Principal Chief Medical Director, Southern Railway and the DRM, Madurai, its joint general secretary P.S. Suriyaprakasam said that railway staff, their spouses and wards and retired personnel, who availed treatment for various ailments at the railway hospital, would face the threat of infecting the virus in case the hospital was converted into a COVID-19 health centre. Since the railways had converted many coaches into isolation wards, the government could use the coaches for treating COVID-19 patients instead of disturbing the systematic working of the hospital, he said."

1354,Tamil Nadu,"April 11, 2020 17:09 IST",Madurai,MADURAI,Panchayat president in Madurai fights myths on COVID-19,"T. Kosemin, president of the Thimmanatham Panchayat in Usilampatti block in Madurai, is doing all he can to bust myths about COVID-19 among the village residents.“There was a widely prevalent notion in our villages that if someone is infected by COVID-19, they would die,” says Mr. Kosemin. To dispel this idea, he and others like him have been attempting to ensure that the 5,000-odd village residents, have better access to information, food and other essential commodities in his Panchayat.Mr. Kosemin has started a WhatsApp group with 256 members from Thimmanatham and Appanampatti villages to regularly raise awareness about the symptoms of COVID-19. Although there have not been any reported cases here, he says that he places emphasis on the need to report cases of fever and cough in their villages and has been asking people to own up to their travel history. “In all parts of rural Madurai, people have not been reporting their travels abroad because they fear stigmatisation. In our villages, there are very few people who travel outside. Our main focus though, is on Thimmanatham and Appanampatti as this is where the maximum number of landless labourers from the Schedule Caste community reside,” he says. Since the announcement of the lockdown, Scheduled Caste members living in colonies have not had access to even basic commodities like rice as ration shops have completely run out of supplies, Mr. Kosemin says. There are a total of 2,080 ration card holders who have procured the ₹1,000 given by the State Government but this is not enough to feed families, he says. Most people here used to earn a living by working as loadmen or as staff members and cleaners at hotels in Usilampatti. After the lockdown, they could not get food or their daily wages, he says. Since April 9, the Panchayat president has distributed 400 packages of vegetables, oil, rice and pulses to SC families in his village. “We are in talks with Revenue Department officials to ensure that the supply to ration shops is regular but we cannot do much except directly step in and buy out of our own pocket during times of delay,” he says. He adds that ever since COVID-19, residents there are diligently wearing towels around their mouths to ensure that the virus does not spread as they do not have masks. “Neighbours are not picking up small children playing on the streets to ensure that there is no transmission too. This is a big change,” he says.Since it is a respiratory disease, there has also been focus on completely stopping the burning of plastic waste in Thimmanatham. “People are instead segregating waste in all these houses,” he says. With adequate help from district administration officials, they are regularly disinfecting the villages, he adds.Mr. Kosemin says that a majority of the villagers in his Panchayat did not light lamps or bang vessels when Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked them to because they wanted to show solidarity against the poor pay that the nurses in their villages were receiving. “Everyone understands that only better funds are necessary during these times as they are all directly impacted by the lack of proper pay,” he says. A senior official from the Revenue Department says that the Civil Supplies Department has been sending adequate commodities in batches but some may have missed their turn. “They have not run out of stock,” he says."

And it always remained a tight rope walking to run the family with this income,” says S. Ayyanan, 55.Hence, Mr. Ayyanan, who works at the TASMAC godown in Manalur in Sivaganga district, never misses even a single working day to make ends meet for his family of four.“All loadmen, being illiterate, never had the habit of saving money for the rainy days and hence, our problem has compounded these days,” says his colleague, M.

The price of essential goods, including the vegetables have gone up these days. Except for brinjal and ladies finger, nothing is cheaper these days,” he says.Both the families have cut down on everything, but basic food to survive.“But, I cannot say no to my children, who ask for biscuits.

The principal employer / establishment employing such workers is required to obtain a registration under the law, while the contractor is also required to obtain a license.“Some of the orders issued under the Disaster Management Act make references to migrant workers and hence the Inter-State Migrant Workmen Act assumes significance.

Ravindaran, a senior advocate pointed out that the implementation of the Act has been a failure in the state of Tamil Nadu, because migrant workers are considered as contract workers.“Migrant workmen are brought to Tamil Nadu by an agent who hands over these persons to a local contractor for a monetary consideration. These migrant workmen virtually become employees of the local contractor who is a licensed contractor under Contract Labour (Regulation & Abolition) Act, 1970, to various companies. Therefore, in Tamil Nadu, the majority of the contract workmen are in reality migrant workmen,” he pointed out.Also read: Lockdown displaces lakhs of migrantsAccording to Tamil Nadu’s Labour Department policy note 2019-20, from 01.04.2018 to 31.03.2019, 6 Registration Certificates and 10 Licenses were issued to the principal employers and contractors respectively under the Act.Tamil Nadu has become forerunner in registering the inter-state migrant workers engaged in construction work in Tamil Nadu Construction Workers Welfare Board. 21,538 inter-state migrant workers have been registered as on 31.03.2019, it added.S.

However, the cancellation of the mega festival this year in view of the COVID-19 pandemic has not just disappointed several lakh of devotees but has also put in deep trouble some 200 Arunthathiyar families from Kariyapatti.Their three-months' of hard work to make water bags out of goat hide, used to spray water on Lord Kallazhagar, has now gone waste.“Each family has got some 200 to 300 hides ready to stitch water bags used exclusively during the grand entry of Lord Kallazhagar into the Vaigai river,” says K. Mullaivendan (30) of Kamarajar Colony. The Arunthathiyar family members who are into different jobs as manual labourers return to the work of processing goat hides into water bags. “It is a laborious work and takes a lot of time,” says K. Marimuthu, who is otherwise a load-man in a local market. The families buy the best quality of goat hide. “We have to ensure that the hides are not damaged while the goats are skinned for meat,” he says. From removing the hairs to make the hide look red, the preservation of hide takes a long process of four weeks. “We need to handle limestone water to various natural herbs to process them,” explains Mr. Mullaivendan.And invariably, these family borrow heavily from local people to buy scores of hides. “Almost the entire family is involved in this work that we have been taking up for several generations. People from other community usually do not prefer this job, as one needs to put up with the bad odour that emanates from the hides,” Mr. Marimuthu says.The families that start their work after Pongal complete the preservation work at least 10 days before the grand event of Lord Kallazhagar’s entry into the Vaigai. “We move with our family members and hides to Madurai and stay put near the Swami Sannithi,” he adds. For any devotee, who dress up like Lord Kallazhagar as part of their vow, the water bag is an integral part of their costume. With hundreds of people, across all age groups, turning up like Lord Kallazhagar, the water bags are sold like hot cakes. “We stitch the hides by ourselves and sometimes engage others as we need to complete the work within a short time. Our sale goes on till the day before Lord Kallazhagar’s entry into the Vaigai. We return home after taking a holy dip in the river,” Mr. Mullaivendan says.Each bag is sold from ₹400 to ₹700 depending upon the size. When they return home with money, it would be time for them to repay their loans. However, with cancellation of the Chithirai festival, all their investment and hard work has put them in a quandary. “We do not know whether these hides have any other utility so that it could fetch us some money,” Mr. Marimuthu wonders.Under the lockdown situation, these families, who have lost all their regular jobs, are burdened with high-interest loans.They are looking for some help from the State Government to overcome the present crisis."

Chandran of the Koyambedu Vegetable Wholesale Merchants Association.“Normally, 20% of the daily arrivals would remain after the sales. But, on Saturday, most traders sold both the day’s arrivals and the previous day’s stocks,” he said.In many parts of Chennai, anxious residents were either crowding or standing in long queues to buy groceries and vegetables.Vijaykumar, a resident of Madipakkam, bought 15 sachets of milk, though the government has said there would be no restrictions sale of the essential commodity.“My milk vendor said there will be no shop for the next four days. So I had to buy in bulk and stock,” Mr Vijaykumar said.In Coimbatore, police and civic officials struggled to ensure distancing at the temporary vegetable markets. “The four-day lockdown will be of no use as people are thronging the shops today and are not maintaining distance,” said M. Vignesh Kumar, an IT employee.In Salem, there was confusion as the Collector on Friday declared district-wide lockdown for the weekend though the Chief Minister had announced it for three days beginning Sunday. Markets and shops were closed.In Madurai, too, most grocery shops saw long queues and crowding, particularly in temporary markets like those set up in Iyer Bungalow, Anna Nagar and Madura College. Police tried valiantly to ensure people wore masks. District Collector T.G. Vinay said 43 high-ranking officials were deployed in various parts of the 100 wards in Madurai district to monitor the situation.(With inputs from Coimbatore and Madurai bureaus)"

The Arogya Setu application, designed by the Centre, is being promoted as an important tool in the fight against COVID-19, primarily for contact tracing. However, organisations such as the Internet Freedom Foundation and Software Freedom Law Centre have raised concerns over privacy issues.In a letter, the Higher Education Secretary asked all universities and regional heads in the department to appoint nodal officers to ensure compliance and send status reports daily. This is based on an earlier letter sent by the Additional Chief Secretary of IT department to other departments, setting a target to take the number of users of this application in Tamil Nadu to at least 50 lakh. Consequently, the Director of Collegiate Education issued a circular on Friday to all Regional Joint Directors of Collegiate Education and principals of government colleges asking the staff of all government, aided and self-financing colleges to download the application.

A majority of the complaints were reported in Ramanathapuram district, followed by Kancheepuram and Chennai. The authorities of the State police master control room noted that physical and verbal abuse over trivial issues were a common cause of complaints. In dozens of cases, withdrawal symptoms due to non-availability of liquor were said to have contributed to the harassment of women by their spouses at home. However, most of the complainants chose not to pursue a criminal case, and instead requested the police to warn the accused and ask them to give a written undertaking that they will not repeat the offence. The complaints received by the master control room were forwarded to the respective city/district police units, and the follow-up action was closely monitored by the State police headquarters.Job insecuritySharing chores at home, monitoring children’s activities, the constant use of mobile phones and the quality of food were among the factors that led to heated arguments or verbal/physical abuse. Many office-goers, particularly those working in small private companies, were under stress due to job insecurity.“A woman police officer is the first respondent for every complaint, and calls the victim over the phone. Then, a team visits the complainant’s house for a preliminary inquiry. In many cases, we found that men addicted to liquor were showing withdrawal symptoms due to the non-availability of liquor during the lockdown period. They show their frustration on women and children at home,” Additional Director-General of Police (Crime against Women and Children) M. Ravi told The Hindu on Saturday. In some cases, neighbours or relatives lodged complaints on behalf of the affected women. Two women officers in the rank of Superintendent of Police, V. Jayashree and A. Kayalvizhi, were monitoring the action taken by the local police on complaints of domestic violence.Personality changeSenior psychiatrist and State nodal officer (police well-being) Dr. C. Ramasubramanian said that one of the major withdrawal symptoms among several alcoholics was a change in personality. Besides health issues including a loss of memory, trembling hands and poor functioning of vital organs, such persons would have a high level of frustration or irritation, driven by a strong urge to consume alcohol at any cost. “In the process, they tend to show their anger on family members. Alcoholism affects the family more than the individual consuming liquor. Be it a physical or a psychological withdrawal, the person has abnormal thoughts and [displays] weird behaviour. This could result in verbal/physical abuse or domestic violence. Addiction to alcohol is completely curable through timely intervention and support from family/friends,” Dr. Ramasubramanian said."

He switched careers, went through rigourous training and turned into a pilot. Today, a first officer with SpiceJet, Mr. Ayyasamy stands tall, risking his life to transport life-saving medicines and ventilators during the COVID-19 lockdown. Like him, several pilots in the country quietly help in delivering vital medical supplies to cities across the country and even abroad.“There is a sense of satisfaction of having achieved and contributed in some little way that I could. I may well consider this to be the high point of my career,” he says. From Bangkok to Bengaluru, he has flown extensively in these trying times to deliver tons of essential cargo from medicines to vegetables.Anush Sachdev, a fleet supervisor line operations with IndiGo, who gave up his lucrative job after completing his MBA to enter aviation sector, says, while he was prepared to take the plunge and operate a flight, his family was reeling under fear. He had to convince them and they realised that it was crucial to pitch in, during such crisis, he says. “An experience that will stay with me is several crew and pilots were stranded in different parts of the country after finishing their duty. I flew them back home in a flight. It was quite moving when all of us got together and everyone had a story to tell,” he adds.Arun Prakash, a captain with SpiceJet, has hopped across the country to places like Thiruvananthapuram, Bengaluru, Kolkata and even Singapore, collecting and dropping off medical essentials from masks to equipment. “Yes, there is some fear deep inside. It may sound clichéd but as pilots, we rise above fears when there is a call of duty. There has been nothing more gratifying then to successfully transport and complete a flight with food or medical supplies, knowing that this will of help to someone in need somewhere,” he adds."
1413,TamilNadu,"April 26, 2020 19:53 IST",Chennai,Chennai,Can’t find a plumber during lockdown? Here comes a database to help you,"Under extreme circumstances, niggly little problems have a way of becoming debilitating. That’s true of a leaky water pipeline in the house, during lockdown. Counted among those providing essential services, plumbers and electricians are allowed to resume work, but there may still be some reluctance on their part to start working and risk an infection.So, it is necessary to find a plumber willing to work during these times. Fortunately, a database of such willing plumbers has been quickly prepared for residents to dip into. Around nine hundred certified plumbers from across India have so far registered themselves for work during the lockdown, with the Indian Plumbing Skills Council which is associated with Skill India programme under the Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship (MSDE). The database will continue to be updated in the days to come.One of the possible benefits of enlisting the services of a plumber entered in this database is that IPSC has made these plumbers COVID-19 aware and sensitive.IPSC has issued health and safety guidelines that the plumbers workforce should follow while working at residential buildings, hospitals, isolation centres, commercial complexes and all other establishments.The advisory includes disinfecting tools and touch points before starting work; promptly disposing of used disposable materials; and encouraging cashless transaction. The plumbers are required to download the Aarogya Setu Mobile App on the phone.Major General (retd.) T.K. Chadha, chief operating officer, IPSC, says that through its training partners in every state they have been taking up various initiatives to mainstream this workforce.“Since 2014, we have trained nearly 1 lakh plumbers across India and formed a database of plumbers,” says Chadha.He says plumbers have been graded depending on the skills and qualifications they possess, and they also have certification from the Government of India. Based on the assessment, plumbers are graded.While this move is commendable during these times, the plumbers say that as sanitary shops are not open they will be able to attend to only certain types of emergency work.Here is a random list of plumbers from major cities, and the list is light years away from being exhaustive.

Her mother and sister wash the soaked rice and keeps it ready in a decades-old pressure cookers. When Kalpana returns with the eggs, it is mixed with the rice, and soon, food is ready for stray dogs.The route begins at Neelankarai and ends at the Marina, and she stops wherever a stray dog is found. When Kalpana arrives, it is meal time for these starving canines.She doesn’t mind making that long drive from Neelankarai to Kamarajar Salai, one bit.The cooked egg rice is kept in large containers.Her uncle V. Balaji ferries her in a moped, They are stopped half-a-dozen times on this route by the police, and after being asked why they are out, and when they give the reason and show the containers filled with cooked rice, they are allowed to go on. “Unlike Eliot's beach where one can find many houses along the seashore making it easy for stray dogs and birds to get their feed, there aren’t many houses or settlements along Marina beach. That's the reason we go all the way to Marina to feed the strays there,” says 35-year-old Kalpana, who is nursing a heartache, having lost her son to electrocution. Inspired by information about volunteering work of this kind posted by individuals on Facebook since the beginning of the lockdown, Kalpana has been feeding the stray dogs. She is helped in this work by neighbours who give her some rice for this work. Besides, a domestic help, she has been persuasive in getting residents of half-a-dozen homes at an apartment complex on ECR to donate rice towards feeding the strays.“She is working in my house for more than four years. When she told me about the plight of these stray animals, we gave away the free rations that was given to us. As everyone cannot venture out now, it's good that we encourage such people who have a heart to do this service for the strays,” says Devi Mohan, a designer and entrepreneur from Neelankarai.Kalpana says, “Once normalcy returns, these stray dogs and birds will find ways to feed themselves. Until then, the four pressure cookers in my house will be busy making a meal for them every day.”"

For more than a week now, it is functioning as a temporary vegetable market for residents of the locality, in addition to the one already established at the open playgrounds of Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School.More than a decade ago, the market was brought under lock and key due to poor patronage, and recently, it captured the imagination of Zone 7 officials of Greater Chennai Corporation as they found themselves having to juggle too many requirements, on account of the lockdown. When the lockdown happened, they established a common vegetable market at the open playgrounds at Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School, a government-aided school on CTH Road, and it has been functioning between the stipulated timings, from 6 a.m to 1 p.m, every day. Besides, the civic officials were also organising door delivery of essential items, mainly vegetables, by vehicles on alternative days to prevent residents from stepping out of their houses.Despite this, they encountered a situation where the footfall at the common vegetable market at the government school increased considerably, especially during weekends. Besides, many residents living in the section along the railway lines have to travel more than two kilometres to reach the temporary market at the school playground. Many residents would walk all the way to the temporary market at the government school. As a result, the defunct farmers market was reopened for the benefit of the residents. “Reopening the farmers' market is a welcome step as it helps residents get fresh farm products and also improves the farmers’ livelihood as they are able to sell directly at the market,” says T. Gunaseelan, a long-time resident of Ambattur Old Town."

They cannot move out on foot to buy vegetables either,” he said.Sunday morning too witnessed panic buying of milk in several places in the city including Tiruvanmiyur, K. K.

1419,TamilNadu,"April 26, 2020 23:38 IST",Chennai,CHENNAI,Coronavirus: Why Chennai reported maximum number of cases in TN,"Chennai has been resolutely at the head of the table of COVID-19 positive cases for a while now. While the first case of a COVID-19 infection was reported at the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital on March 7, it was actually a resident of Kancheepuram.As a tertiary health care centre, it is likely that a large number of referrals or patients themselves seeking care are reporting in Chennai’s hospitals from the neighbouring districts as well. Be that as it may, there is still a pressing need to turn the spotlight on the city, which has had an average of just over 54% of daily new cases since April 19.April 19 seems to be the day the apple cart was upset in Chennai. For the first time, Chennai accounted for 50 of the 105 positive cases that day. From cruising at about with a share of 14% of the daily Statewide new cases, the figure suddenly shot up to 46%. The next big spike, the highest so far in the epidemic, was on April 21 when with 55 of the 76 new cases, Chennai’s share touched (its peak yet) over 72.4%. However, as a percentage of the total number of active cases in the State, Chennai still remained at under 20, but in subsequent days rose and was at 27.7 % (of active cases) on Sunday.Public health experts say density of population is at the core of the issue. “With about 26,000 persons per sq. km., the population density in Chennai is unparalleled compared to any other part of the State,” says P. Kuganantham, former Chennai Corporation Health Officer. It is a tertiary care centre with a large number of government and private hospitals serving COVID-19 patients, he points out. Those who test positive in Chennai may not actually be from the city. “I believe that higher number of positive cases per se need not be a source of worry, as in epidemic control it is read as the presence of a good testing mechanism. But we need to do everything to minimise risk to people,” he says.Higher number of testsHealth Minister C. Vijayabaskar says one other reason for the high number of positives is that higher number of tests being done in Chennai. If 7,000 tests are done daily in the State, at least 1,000 to 2,000 of them are in the capital city and there are plans to increase this.“The government does feel the need to focus on Chennai and the Chief Minister appointed additional officers to monitor the COVID-19 situation here,” he says. In addition, facilities have been made to provide real time results of tested samples via a mobile portal. The batches of samples are run in three shifts every day, ensuring that the results are delivered faster, he adds."

Their source of infection was traced to a sanitation worker who worked in the PG men’s hostel on contract. Already, 23 medical, paramedical staff and workers of the hospital have tested positive for COVID-19. A majority of them were from the Department of Cardiology in the hospital. Of this, six postgraduates and a staff nurse were discharged last week. Hospital authorities said three more staff nurses were discharged on Monday.One block of MMC’s PG men’s hostel was vacated, disinfected and brought under containment. Of the 102 PGs who were tested, 100 samples returned negative for COVID-19. Similarly, all those doing CRRI (Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship) were tested and were found to be negative. As on date, 471 doctors, 363 nurses and paramedical personnel were tested, the medical college said in a release on Sunday.Area sealedA doctor said the PG men’s hostel in Broadway was now a containment zone and the area sealed. “No other medical college hospital has so many health care providers or workers as COVID-19 positive patients like the RGGGH. The available manpower has not been utilised well and all are exposed to the infection. As of now, only 30% workforce is required for COVID-19 duty, and general patients, and the rest can be kept as reserve,” he said.A few PGs said some of them were screened for COVID-19 earlier. “Now, two PGs have tested positive, and so, the tests should be conducted again. Many of us were asked to assemble at the same time for the test. This was wrong as it could lead to spread of infection. There should be periodical testing for all of us,” one of them said. He added that the laboratory report was not given to them and they were only informed of the result. “Those on COVID-19 duty share the same dressing rooms. We need more dressing rooms, and rooms for donning and doffing of personal protective equipment. Only a few wards have such separate facilities. A separate duty roster should be created for CRRIs,” another PG said. Dean denies reportsWhile several messages that the hospital’s safety was compromised and patient care was affected are doing the rounds, hospital dean R. Jayanthi termed all such messages as fake. “The situation is under control. The two PGs had come in contact with the sanitary worker, and did not work in the COVID-19 ward. We have an adequate number of PGs in non-COVID medical and surgical wards,” she said. She added that CRRIs have started to work from Monday - at RGGGH and at its affiliated institutions - Government Kasturba Gandhi Hospital for Women and Children, Triplicane and Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Hospital for Women and Children, Egmore. “One-third of the CRRIs are kept under reserve,” she said. The block housing the Department of Cardiology that was closed for disinfection works would be operational from Tuesday, she added. A message forwarded by the authorities said any PG with a history of possible unintentional exposure during work was being screened. Based on the reports of screening tests done so far, there was no evidence of any significant or widespread infection among doctors, PGs or staff nurses and there was no truth in the rumours."

The bot has essential information ranging from helplines, updates on COVID-19 to testing centres and details about the restrictions in place,” explained Shaamil. Shaamil and Shaaban met with officials from the GCC and worked with them towards identifying standard queries for which they could provide speedy responses. The Chabot, which is now live on the Chennai Corporation’s Facebook page, asks users if they wish to converse in English or Tamil and then proceeds to show a selection menu with options regarding the information they need. “A resident who is looking for information regarding the latest announcements by the GCC about restrictions, the procedure to apply for travel passes or even to find out where the testing centre nearest to them is can make use of the information the Chatbot provides,” he said. Ever since the lockdown began, the Corporation has been actively using social media to inform and address concerns of the residents online. “We get hundreds of queries on a daily basis and several queries are usually about information that we have already put out on our social media handles or on our website. The Chatbot effectively collates this information and will be faster in providing this to social media users,” said a senior official from the Corporation’s social media team. As a next step, Shaamil and Shaaban said that they are looking to make the Chatbot available for Twitter and telegram as well."
1422,TamilNadu,"April 27, 2020 14:04 IST",Health,Coimbatore,Breast milk donation during COVID-19 in Coimbatore,"Five months ago, Dharani Rajesh, a home-maker from Erode was diagnosed with a hormonal imbalance. Her doctor put her on medication and advised her not to breastfeed her then three-month-old child. “It was the hardest phase of my life. I felt helpless. I knew the importance of breast milk and began looking for people who were ready to donate. I found a mother from the Coimbatore Parenting Network (CPN) Facebook page and collected a batch of milk packets from her. Later, I found another mom near my home who still donates for me,” she says.Several mothers like Dharani depend on donated breast milk. “Each drop of breast milk donated can change the life of a child. Rich in antibodies, it strengthens the immune system and keeps infections away,” says Dr Senthilkumar P, senior neonatologist, Coimbatore Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) which has a fully functional human milk bank. He says that several babies born at the hospital are premature and need assisted feeding while their mothers recover after childbirth. “Donated breast milk is a blessing for them. It is also helpful for mothers with twins or triplets who do not produce enough milk and for those who have medical conditions that do not allow them to feed,” he says.As it is with a lot of services, the lockdown has brought its own set of difficulties in procurement of donated breast milk. Roopa Selvanayaki, admin of the online group Amirtham, that promotes breast milk donation says, “For two years now, we are donating to CMCH’s breast milk bank. Now, it is hard for us to go and collect milk from donors.” When Amirtham shared this problem with the doctors of the hospital, Dr Senthilkumar came forward and collected 155 packets with a total of 27 litres of milk from 14 mothers of the group. Roopa spoke to doctors and they reassured her that donating breast milk during COVID 19 was safe. Once that was done, she spread the good word on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. “Recently five moms from Erode were ready with 75 packets of milk. We sought help from police officials and they collected it and dropped it off at CMCH,” explains Roopa.Info you can useAny healthy lactating mother can donateThe pumped milk can be stored in glass bottles, BPA free plastic bottles or milk collection bags.The blood reports of donors are collected to make sure they do not carry any infectious diseases.The milk is also pasteurised before it is stored in the bankThere is some confusion about the safety of donating breast milk during the lockdown and that is the reason things have not been going too smoothly for Uyirthuli, a breast milk donation initiative by CPN.“Usually we donate once in a month. But after the lockdown, we did not receive any response from our members. We realised that there is a lot of confusion around breast milk donation and did not want to push anyone,” says Aishwarya M, Coordinator of Uyirthuli.But Dr Senthilkumar sets fears at rest when he says, “The coronavirus does not spread through breast milk. But as a precaution, it is always best for the mother to cover her face with a mask and use gloves while pumping and handling the packets.” The milk is also pasteurised to ensure safety. “The breast milk bank now has enough milk packets to last for another 10 days. We hope to receive another batch by the time this stock is over,” he says."
1423,TamilNadu,"April 27, 2020 13:08 IST",Chennai,CHENNAI,Koyambedu market may be shifted out,"A decision on temporarily shifting the Koyambedu wholesale vegetable and fruits market, as a precautionary measure, is likely to be taken on Tuesday after a second round of talks between officials and traders’ associations.This comes in the wake of physical distancing norms being flouted at the market. During a meeting with traders' associations on Monday, City Police Commissioner A.K. Viswanathan said the market will have to be closed if four or more persons in the complex test positive for COVID-19. Traders indulged in retail sale of vegetables and fruits on the pretext of wholesale sales and physical distancing norms were flouted at the market, he added. Moreover, two persons associated with the market had tested positive for COVID-19.Agriculture Secretary Gagandeep Singh, Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority Member Secretary D. Karthikeyan and Chennai Corporation Commissioner G. Prakash were among those who held the meeting to examine the feasibility of shifting the market to Madhavaram and Kilambakkam.Traders have, however, sought time to decide. Noting that it would be difficult to shift the market immediately, they said retailers should be restricted from operating in the market as retail sales brought in crowds.According to wholesale traders, a hair salon owner on ‘A’ Road near the market and a lorry driver who transported fruits from Maharashtra had tested positive for COVID-19.'Split operations'V.R. Soundararajan, a wholesale merchant, said wholesale traders could be split into groups. Merchants dealing with onions, tomatoes and potatoes alone could use a five-acre space in the market.Traders noted that COVID-19 samples were yet to be taken in the market. S. Srinivasan, a wholesale fruit merchant, suggested that the government could temporarily shift the market to the nearby private omnibus stand and Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus.An official of the Chennai Corporation said public health experts had recommended the shifting of the market to other locations. But it was a challenging task. “We are not sure if the traders will agree to the proposal. We do not want traders to start protesting against the move to shift the market. It will lead to scarcity of essential commodities in the city,” he added.While a senior CMDA official said a decision to shift the wholesale market to three different locations was likely to be taken on Tuesday, civic officials said the CMDA should at least clear encroachments at the market to promote social distancing."

He tried getting back to India on March 13, as soon as the Centre issued a circular that incoming flights were going to be barred from midnight GMT that day, but narrowly missed the cut-off time. Today, neither Australia wants visitors like him to hang around nor has India opened its doors, as a result of which he was forced to travel to the U.S., where he feels he has higher chances of contracting the novel coronavirus.Uneventful“I had uneventful flights from Sydney to San Francisco and then to New Jersey [where his son lives]. But the biggest surprise was that I was never screened or questioned before takeoff at Sydney or after arrival at San Francisco and also at Newark. I picked up my bags and came home,” Mr. Raghu told The Hindu soon after he reached the U.S. on Monday.Mr. Raghu, who graduated from the Indian Statistical Institute (ISI) in Kolkata, moved to the U.S. back in 1981 and became an American citizen, but at the age of 60 returned to India to again make Chennai his home. Inveterate travellerAn inveterate traveller, he went to Australia in early February to catch up with friends and family members spread out there, and he had barely returned to Sydney after a brief visit to Perth — where a niece and a former ISI classmate live — before news came that India was barring incoming flights from March 12.Mr. Raghu said: “You should read the Government of India circular of March 12. According to it, the cut-off time was 12:00 GMT at port of departure on March 13. But people at the airline interpreted it as arrival by 12:00 GMT. So I missed the arrival cut-off by three hours. They didn’t allow me to board.“The friend I was staying with in Sydney had scheduled to renovate the house after my departure. Out of desperation, I called my niece in Perth who was herself a paying guest. Staying with my ISI friend was also not an option because he had his daughter and son-in-law as visitors. Finally she requested her host to let me stay with them and I quickly bought a ticket to Perth. I got a seat on Virgin Australia and there were rumours they will file for bankruptcy leaving me with a worthless ticket. Fortunately, my flight took off and very soon thereafter Virgin stopped all flights.Fitness freak“But because I missed the flight to India, I was able to enjoy Perth. I am a fitness freak and just cannot be locked up for too long. “With no end in sight for India letting me in, I had to find some activity to keep my sanity and health going. Luckily, Perth had its lovely bicycle trails everywhere, including by the side of highways. So, I took a spot decision to invest in a used bicycle.“Initially, I found it hard to be on the bike for even an hour, but soon my leg muscles got used to it and within two weeks I was able to comfortably do three hours every day. Weather became cooler and on weekends I did even up to four hours with my young niece. I fell in love with Perth.“But when India extended the lockdown and denied entry to even stranded Indian citizens, I became desperate and contacted both the Indian and the U.S. consulates, asking them to request the Australian government to extend my stay beyond the 90-day limit. Both of them sent me stock responses via email. “The message from Australia was clear to all visitors: Go back.“The only flight to the U.S. was from Sydney and so my challenge was to find a ticket that took me via Sydney. Though Australia is also under lockdown, each state was operating one flight a day for essential travel and I guess I fell under that category.”“Now, in the U.S., there is the fear of the dreaded medical bills should anything happen, God forbid. I can only pray and hope I do not contract COVID-19.”"

Once the COVID-19 lockdown was lifted and transportation including air traffic opened, the data from this portal could be used in allowing them to return as well as quarantine them, he said.Kerala government has already set up a portal allowing its natives working abroad to register. “We are expecting about a lakh workers to return,” he added.Another official said a lot depended on when and how the Centre would open up air traffic into the country.“The subject of air traffic was discussed during the recent video conference the Prime Minister had with the Chief Ministers. So, naturally, we need to plan on how to manage the inflow of NRI workers,” he said.Professor S. Irudaya Rajan of the Centre for Development Studies (CDS) in Thiruvananthapuram, a noted expert researching on migrants, feels an estimated 2.5 lakh Tamil workers could return from abroad. “Over 25 lakh workers from Tamil Nadu are employed in various countries and of them, I expect at least 10% of them to return this year,” he said.Planning ahead was necessary as to who should be allowed preference since most of them would be in a rush to return. “Priority would be given naturally to pregnant women, children and elderly persons.”According to Mr. Rajan some 12 lakh workers are employed in the Gulf countries. “Almost all the countries are affected by COVID-19 and because of the repercussions, most of them would want to or be forced to come back home, if they could not continue to work there anymore,” he said and pointed out there may not be any job for them here too at once. Tamil Nadu and Kerala had 25 lakh and 22 lakh of their people working abroad respectively, which constituted almost one-fourth of 200 lakh Indians workers employed abroad, he said.Based on a survey of a random sample of 25,000 households across Tamil Nadu in 2015, his team of researchers have put the figure as 25 lakh.Mr. Rajan emphasised that in many households, the family was dependent on the remittances made by their family member employed abroad and once he/she lost his/her job, the family would have to find another source of income.

Word quickly spread that a 36 year-old driver from their camp had tested positive for COVID-19. A senior official from the Health Department of the Madurai Corporation said that they had tested all the contacts of the patient including relatives and employers. He added that they immediately began asking people to stay at home and reiterated it continuously.“We understood that it was essential to remain in our houses to ensure that we can contain the disease spread. The district administration and Corporation officials walked us through the entire process and we were asked to remain in complete quarantine for a brief period. Everyone quickly accustomed,” said K. Karthik, a 37 year-old resident. Mr. Karthik and his family have been residing in the camp since the year 1990 after seeking refuge in India. Along with him, there are around 320 families in the camp. Although they have gone through the experience of escaping their country to seek refuge in India, living through a pandemic is pretty challenging too, he says. But help of officials and kind hearted strangers have kept many residents there afloat. “Health workers regularly knock on our doorstep and ask us if we have experienced any symptoms. They also spray disinfectants every day. Police are monitoring our activities through drone cameras and the Corporation is ensuring that we receive proper vegetable supply and no one is allowed to enter the camp without permission,” he says. Some politicians and locals too have come and dropped off dry rations. The kind gesture has helped many families ensure that they at least get a meal a day.Many residents like Mr. Karthik are thankful for the support they have received. However, all the free time they have in their hands has made them wonder about an income-less present and an uncertain future. T. Silandhiran, a painter who has been residing in the camp, says that most Sri Lankan Tamil refugees are daily wage workers. They work as painters, construction workers and linesmen. They live on their daily wages and barely get enough money to save. With the extension of the lockdown, Mr. Silandhiran says that it may be difficult for his family to afford the ₹100 bag of vegetables that the Corporation distributes through its mobile vans. “I have to find a neighbour who will split the vegetables with me because I simply cannot afford the bags for longer. I am not sure what I will do,” he says. Even before COVID-19, Mr. Silandhiran says that many people from the camp had difficulties finding jobs. “Some employers earlier would take pity on our plight and engage us in menial work because hoteliers and companies would reject hiring us for permanent jobs due to our Sri Lankan heritage. With heavy job losses, I wonder if it will be easy for us to get jobs later,” he says. Another resident, A. Jayanthini, who has completed B.Sc. in Information Technology, says that most graduates at the Sri Lankan refugee camps work for daily wage. “It is sad to think that some people have MBA, MCA and B. Tech degrees and are painting and digging pits for laying electrical lines. Post COVID-19, most employees will face salary cuts and fewer days of work too. How do we brace for these times,” she asks. Besides, families which get a maximum of ₹2,000 as allowance from the State Government must manage with the amount for their daily expenses including the purchase of medicines and groceries.Mr. Silandhiran says that since their worries for a post-COVID 19 time end up occupying their mind on a regular basis, most stick to watching the television as a means distract themselves.Since houses are located very close to each other, afternoon matinee shows playing on popular channels blare from all houses. “It feels like collectively watching cinema in different houses,” he says. Some others engage their children and youngsters make TikTok videos, he adds as it an escape.To ease their burden, it would be useful if the helpful non-governmental organisation donate free rations, vegetables and fruits, he says. “We require all the charity we can get,” he adds."

Sharing some quality birds with new comers will ease the burden faced by longtime pigeon fanciers and also help the sport to grow further,” says 40-year-old Raam, an entrepreneur who has been keeping pigeons for a decade.He has more than 100 racing homing pigeons.At present, Chennai has 14 pigeon racing clubs with each club having around 50 members. Each member, on an average, has 50 to 100 racing pigeons. Forty percent of the racing pigeon fanciers, have more than 200 racing birds each. In a loft of 200 pigeons there could be 80 young pigeons.Many seasoned pigeon fanciers with huge lofts keep one-fifth of their young pigeons, thereby preserving certain bloodlines, and offer the rest to new fanciers, usually for free, to avoid the strain and challenge of providing for a huge loft during these times, when access to essentials is a challenge.The pigeon racing stretches from January and May every year.New feeding programme Further, in the lockdown period, pigeon fanciers have to alter their their feeding programme, and in some cases, this means feeding pigeons only once a day, mostly in the evening, as against the usual routine of twice-a-day feeding.Vegetables have replaced traditional multi-vitamin supplements. Raw eggs also come as an alternative nutrient as they are mixed with ragi and offered to racing pigeons.“Due to lockdown restrictions, transportation of pigeon grains from a few shops that sell these grains in Seven Wells remains a challenge. So, many fanciers ration the limited grains they have,” says S. Arun Kumar, another fancier. Noted filmmaker C. Vetrimaaran is a pigeon fancier, with a passel of pigeons, numbering well over 300, at his loft. On an average, he buys around 80 kilograms of mixture grain, which include corn, wheat, bajra, green gram, roasted Bengal gram, soyabeen and oil seeds like Saffola, sunflower, linseed and green peas, for a fortnight. “So far so good. All pigeons are safe. And I am managing to source what they need, so that they are fed as well as they used to be before the lockdown,” says Vetrimaaran."

She had no diabetes or hypertension and fell in the low risk category. However, she developed fits and collapsed suddenly. Doctors and staff in the ward tried to revive her, and performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation. But she collapsed and died. The baby also died, official sources said. An official of the Health department said the ward and operation theatre were being disinfected. “First of all, we have told all doctors to fully protect themselves when attending to pregnant women, especially those coming from containment zones. When they come to the hospital in labour pain, we cannot immediately test them. So, we have asked all doctors and staff to protect themselves and attend to the expectant mothers. They will be screened simultaneously. We will look at those with symptoms and their susceptibility,” he said.

He said Chennai topped the list of COVID-19 positive cases in the State and the zonal office of Southern Railway and Chennai divisional headquarters were located in close proximity to the Rajiv Gandhi Government Hospital, which was a containment area.The fact that doctors, para-medical staff and other frontline workers were themselves getting infected only showed the tenacity of coronavirus and the susceptibility of normal human beings. “It is not advisable to open the headquarters, division offices and workshops in Chennai area as it will be against the interest of hundreds of employees and their family members.”Mr. Kanniah, who is also the general secretary of the Southern Railway Mazdoor Union, said the suspension of public transport was an obstacle since employees, despite having duty passes, had to go through the ordeal of severe restrictions on travel and frequent checks by law-enforcing agencies. “If normal transport facilities are restored, opening of offices can definitely be done since it would mean that the area is safe and the government has officially declared it as such,” he said."

1450,TamilNadu,"May 02, 2020 00:18 IST",Chennai,CHENNAI,Coronavirus | Metrowater tests show prevalence of viral RNA in sewage collected from Chennai,"Chennai Metrowater has detected the presence of COVID-19 RNA in sewage samples collected in Chennai as part of a preliminary study. For the study, sewage samples were randomly collected from five sewage pumping stations across the city and were analysed for the presence of the COVID-19 viral RNA. The samples were tested through the RT-PCR technique at two accredited labs. According to sources, the presence of the COVID-19 viral RNA was detected in two samples and a correlation of confirmed cases was also established in the locations from where samples were lifted. “However, studies across the world show that detection of virus in sewage is not an indication that the virus may be infectious. COVID-19 transmission does not occur through sewage. The process of sewage treatment, including chlorination, kills the virus,” according to a source. Metrowater partnered with World Health Organisation India to devise a study and evolve guidelines for control of COVID-19 through wastewater surveillance. Sources said it could probably be the first time in the country where COVID-19 RNA has been successfully detected in sewage.In case of asymptomatic infections, it would come in handy to identify COVID-19 carriers in an area and help step up screening and other intervention measures. Citing studies in many countries, including Netherlands, sources said the disease could be identified in faeces within three days of infection. The wastewater-based epidemiology approach would help alert a population cluster that is covered by a specific sewage treatment plant. Regular monitoring of wastewater even after the disease subsides would serve as an indicator to determine whether the pandemic has been brought under control."

On the one hand, the four government hospitals in the city are filling up fast, while on the other, arrangements are on to increase bed strength and simultaneously establish institutional quarantine for stable patients.In the last five days, 558 persons have tested positive in Chennai. The city has four designated COVID-19 facilities in the government sector — Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital (RGGGH), Government Stanley Medical College Hospital, Government Kilpauk Medical College (KMC) Hospital and Government Medical College Hospital, Omandurar Estate. An official of the Health Department said as of now, there was adequate bed capacity for COVID-19 patients in Chennai. “Both RGGGH and Omandurar Hospital have around 150 patients each. Each of these hospitals have a capacity of 500 beds. This means the remaining 350 beds are vacant. KMC has around 200 positive patients. Already, work is under way to create institutional quarantine facilities including at a Er college close to KMC,” he said. The Government Stanley Medical College Hospital has around 175 patients (as on Friday morning). Authorities said they were gradually increasing the bed strength and will have 400 beds in a week. Officials said KMC was running out of beds and also faced a space crunch as it was catering to a large section of regular patients too. ‘KMC at full capacity’“The hospital receives about 700 outpatients, and an equal number of in-patients everyday. It is running to its full capacity. The hospital has an exclusive burns ward that has to be functional, and is conducting more deliveries than its usual numbers. Its paediatrics unit is also fully functional,” an official said. In fact, a few days ago, 55 positive patients were admitted to the hospital on a single day. This is why segregating COVID-19 patients as per their condition, and keeping beds in hospitals for those who require medical attention is crucial, doctors say. “As per the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines, patients who are asymptomatic, stable, healthy and with no active illness can be shifted to institutional quarantine and kept under the supervision of doctors. We have found that less than 10% of the patients are symptomatic. So, we can safely shift at least 50% of patients to institutional quarantine. This can include persons with no fever and clear chest X-ray or CT scan,” an official explained.This, he added, would make space for patients in need of hospital care, specialist intervention and intensive care."

Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami and Deputy Chief Minister O. Panneerselvam were among those present. As soon as the meeting began at about 11 a.m., Chief Secretary K.

What it did was to peruse the guidelines of the Union Ministry of Home Affairs, issued at different points of time in April and the latest one on May 1, before taking the decisions. There were only “marginal differences” between the conditions for red and orange zones. However, as the State government did not completely act on the MHA’s notifications of April 15 and 16 with regard to allowing a number of economic activities, it had now decided to give effect to most of the revised guidelines.Among the non-containment zones, the Cabinet distinguished between those falling under the jurisdiction of the Greater Chennai Police and those in the remaining areas of the State. Compared to the Chennai region where the number of cases was on the rise, it chose to give more relaxations for the rest of the State. For example, in respect of the IT/ITeS sector, the permitted quantum of staff strength is 10% for firms in and around Chennai, while it is 50% in other parts of the State.The Cabinet took a conscious decision of treating the textile sector cautiously as it received feedback from Ministers of the western belt that the scope was “limited” for adherence to norms of personal distancing at mills. With regard to infrastructure or road works, the Cabinet’s recommendation was that the services of locally available labour should be utilised. “We cannot go on with the present state for months together as the livelihood opportunities of a large number of the poor are at stake,” pointed out Mr. Shanmugam. Another official said that “to the extent possible”, the government had struck a balance between social and economic goals.Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | State-wise tracker for coronavirus cases, deaths and testing ratesAsked about the continued denial of permission for salons and beauty parlours, the official replied that given the nature of service to be rendered to customers, the chances were extremely limited for adhering to the norms on personal distancing.

With restrictions on the movement of residents due to lockdown, many residents’ groups depend on CCTV cameras to ensure safety in the locality. ""As our lone security guard is absent due to lockdown for more than a month, we depend entirely on CCTV cameras to keep an eye on goings and the movement of strangers in our neighbourhood. Since the lockdown began, every day, a few members of our residents association screen the previous day's CCTV footage to take stock of the safety situation in the locality. Whenever necessary, we also inform residents about what was noticed in the footage, through WhatsApp,"" says V. Rajagopal, president, Anna Nagar Western Extension Phase – II Residents Welfare Association,Residents say that installation of CCTV cameras in the locality, which includes Officers’ Colony and TVS Colony in Anna Nagar Western Extension, have been a key factor in instilling a sense of security in residents. The neighbourhood has 20 CCTV cameras, each with a storage capacity equalling 21 days of recording. The netowork of CCTV cameras cover all the 12 streets in the locality. In fact, with the number of CCTV cameras in the neighbourhood steadily increasing since 2013, the number of security guards has reduced from three persons to one. In Ambattur, there are many apartment complexes that invest in CCTV cameras, and at least a couple of cameras installed at an apartment complex are directed towards the road. In Thiruvengada Nagar, off CTH Road, most of the CCTV cameras in operation are those that have been installed by residents of apartment complexes; only eight cameras have been installed by the residents’ association. “We get feedback from individual apartment complexes on the CCTV footage every day. We also have a few security guards who alert about the movement of people in public places within the neighbourhood. Since the lockdown, there haven’t been any petty thefts or acts of crime in our locality. Yet, we will continue to monitor our CCTV cameras regularly,” says S. Suresh, secretary, Thiruvengada Nagar Residents Welfare Association. Consising of 138 plots spread across 10 streets, Thiruvengada Nagar supports a population of 1000 families. Most of the residents are employed in government sectors and at the industrial units in Pattaravakkam, Athipet and Ambattur. The neighbourhood is located between Ambattur and Korattur lakes on the elevated landscape. Regular monitoring Three decades ago, in the early 1980s, residents of Thiruvengada Nagar would go on night patrolling in the neighbourhood. In Pattabiram near Avadi, residents have installed more than a dozen CCTV cameras and check the footage regularly. Now, the police are informed about the movement of vehicles including trucks and cars, on daily basis after checking the footage in the cameras — residents do this to check the unnecessary movement of people during lockdown."

The order for an open-ended ban was on the basis of petitions by parties interested in keeping the State-run liquor shops closed.On the issue of online liquor sales and home delivery, Tamil Nadu said the Supreme Court had clarified on May 8 that a decision on online sales and home delivery of liquor would be entirely left to the discretion of the States.“The Supreme Court order recognised that States have a broad margin of power to determine whether and how to effect sales of liquor in this lockdown period,” Tamil Nadu's appeal said.It said no other State, except Maharashtra where the virus figures were three to four times more than Tamil Nadu, sold liquor exclusively through online means.

Usually, the bus stand area, the roads leading to NRT Nagar, Allinagaram and other locations in the vicinity used to witness more number of motorists during the day time.

While it may not be possible for everyone to remain home for long, it was also equally important to ensure that those who had to genuinely step out should be given space to move around. Using the technology, the residents would be monitored closely and random checking had already begun across the district. Those categorised under essential services such as doctors, farmers and those on COVID-19 duty would however, be permitted without any restrictions, he added.With the governments relaxing curfew norms in a phased manner, the SMS facility may help to stagger crowding and social distancing, mandatory for COVID-19 to break, officials said."

It was a very sensitive diagnostic tool available for laboratory confirmation of infectious diseases.A status report filed by K.S. Selvakumar, Additional Secretary, Health Department, pointed out that the molecular diagnostic tool requires a dedicated molecular biology lab/RT-PCR having three separate cubicles viz., sample preparation room, master mix room and PCR room as recommended by World Health Organisation (WHO).“All three of these cubicles need to be designed in uni-directional work flow. Sample preparation room should have bio safety cabinet class II A2/B2 to handle highly infectious and clinical materials so as to ensure no bio safety issues,” he added. The RT-PCR technique as a point of care in the form of mobile labs “require absolute validation in terms of bio safety and so mobile testing labs cannot be established.”The report was filed in response to a public interest litigation petition filed for testing all those who reside on footpaths, roadsides and street corners for COVID-19. It made it clear that there was no necessity to test all homeless people unless they suffer from symptoms.RT-PCR test kits The Additional Secretary told the court that orders had been placed for procurement of 14.33 lakh RT-PCR test kits of which 5.12 lakh had already been received as on Tuesday. Further, the Centre had given 50,000 kits to the State and donors too had contributed 53,516 kits.Totally, 6.15 lakh kits were available in the State as on May 12. Further, providing a breakup, he said, most of the kits were procured from two South Korean companies and the rest from an Indian company and that all of them were approved by Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR).The court was also told that 2.66 lakh samples were tested in the State as on Tuesday. After recording the submissions and expressing satisfaction over the steps taken by the government, the Division Bench closed the PIL petition."
1498,TamilNadu,"May 13, 2020 23:47 IST",Chennai,CHENNAI,Coronavirus | Resettlement colonies at risk of becoming clusters,"Cramped for space, resettlement colonies in and around the city are now staring at the threat of COVID-19.Three of the major Tamil Nadu Slum Clearance Board (TNSCB) resettlement colonies at Kannagi Nagar, Perumbakkam and Semmenchery have already reported cases. According to officials, 27 residents of Kannagi Nagar have tested positive. Thirteen are index cases and the remaining household contacts. Of the index cases, seven to eight persons are linked to the Koyambedu cluster. In Semmenchery, six persons have tested positive, while two have tested positive in Perumbakkam.Maintaining physical distancing and isolation at home is next to impossible in both slums and resettlement colonies. Consider this: it is estimated that there are over 3 lakh households in nearly 2,170 slums in the city, according to officials in TNSCB. The three major colonies account for over 50,000 houses and the size of each house ranges between 120 to 400 sq.ft.Fear among residents  A cross-section of residents of TNSCB resettlement colonies said they fear that the infection may spread quickly as houses are located close to each other and containment measures are not enforced properly. “There are over 23,000 houses in Kannagi Nagar and Ezhil Nagar. All of them are located close to each other. It is very difficult to follow personal distancing as the size of the houses ranges between 120 sq. feet to 220 sq. feet and people sit outside to get some fresh air,” said Stephen, a resident of Kannagi Nagar.Despite COVID -19 cases in the locality, residents claim that Kannagi Nagar has not been demarcated as a containment zone. “The entry and exit points have not been blocked. Many residents are daily wage earners, and they step out hoping to get some work,” added another resident.Similar is the complaint from residents of Perumbakkam and Semmenchery. “The entry and exit points to the Perumbakkam tenements were blocked two weeks ago after the first case was reported. However, they are not enforced strictly as people from other parts of the city continue to visit their relatives,” a resident said.In Semmenchery, residents said metal sheets with ample space for a person to pass through have been placed to block entry to houses of infected persons. “However, people continue to enter and leave the dwelling units,” said K. Kanchana, a resident. “No physical distancing is followed. People also walk around without masks,” she said.‘Screening elderly residents’P. Kuganantham, former city health officer, said, “There is no spacing and so, the chances of disease transmission are high. All elderly residents should be screened. Many of the women here are anaemic and should be given zinc and vitamin tablets to build immunity. It is important to provide supplements.”Officials of the Greater Chennai Corporation said 150 fever survey workers were on door-to-door surveillance duty, covering 23,000 households in Kannagi Nagar. “We are getting good data from the ILI survey. In fact, four cases were picked up from the survey. We will be conducting four fever camps here. We have also set up a dedicated control room for Kannagi Nagar and Semmenchery which people can contact in case of symptoms,” an official said. Being high priority and high risk areas, enforcement teams were deployed and all street vendors were told to wear masks. “We are trying to distribute reusable cloth masks to all 23,000 households,” he added. The Corporation not only shifted positive patients to care centres but also their household contacts, and individuals residing in two to three nearby homes to temporary facilities, he said.Public health officials said persons with symptoms were being tested “We are advising those aged above 60 to stay home and are providing them with masks. Their houses are small but it is better that they avoid coming in contact with people outside,” an official said."

At least a two-metre distance should be maintained to limit close contact between the health staff and “potentially-infectious patients” in OPD rooms.All COVID-19 patients should be housed in single rooms. If sufficient single rooms are not available, beds could be set up at least a metre away from one another. Oxygen provision should be made and at least two to three cylinders should be in working condition.Non-critical patient care equipment should be available for patients.

Incidentally, at this hospital, he was also tested for COVID-19 in an authorized lab in the city and he tested positive. He was subsequently shifted to a private hospital in Manapakkam, Chennai.Sources at Chennai Port said contact tracing was done immediately and further investigations are on. “The ship has been completely disinfected and its 26 crew members have been asked to be kept in isolation inside the ship. Their health conditions are monitored daily” an official said.Now, Chennai Port authorities have been trying to locate the source of the infection and where the crew member acquired it. “If not for his pain, he wouldn’t have disembarked at all.

This was followed by the spread of information that another train will leave for Assam on Wednesday evening, and a select group of people, who had registered themselves with the governments of both Tamil Nadu and Assam, had been asked to come in for medical screening, a member of the Assam Association in Chennai said, on condition of anonymity. As this piece of information spread rapidly among the migrant community, hundreds descended on the Assam Bhawan in Pallikaranai on Wednesday, throwing personal distancing norms to the wind. Since there was no such train service, contrary to what they had been led to believe, the workers were asked to return to their places of stay and wait for further communication. On Thursday, many gathered at the Guru Nanak College in Velachery, which was serving as a shelter for migrant workers. After waiting with their luggage for a long time, they were allowed by the authorities to take shelter inside the premises and provided with food.Later, tension prevailed as many workers gathered near the MGR Central railway station.

Cases linked to this market have been steadily increasing, with the infection quietly spreading to less-affected districts of Tamil Nadu.As of May 8, 2020, out of the 6000 cases recorded in Tamil Nadu, more than 1,500 cases are linked to this market.COVID-19 | Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in IndiaHow did this happen? Established in 1996, the Koyambedu market complex is one of Asia’s largest hubs for perishable goods. It is spread over 65 acres and has over 3,750 licensed shops selling flowers, fruits and vegetables. The market receives its produce from several parts of the country and employs more than 10,000 labourers. On any given day, the market would see at least one lakh visitors. It would go upto two lakh visitors on festival days. Therefore overcrowding and congestion was a common sight at the Koyambedu market. It was no different during the first phase of lockdown. The rush grew when the State government imposed restrictions on working hours. The market continued to receive a steady flow of people, which included retailers as well as individual customers.Ahead of the Tamil New Year on April 14, the market witnessed a heavy rush. Thereafter, the situation persisted as people resorted to panic buying. During all this, there was a scant regard for physical distancing. Efforts were taken to close some parts of the market and restrict the crowds. But, the virus had already spread leaving the market conducive for transmission. During the lockdown, labourers from the market did not have enough work and made their way back home. By the end of April, the Koyambedu market turned into the largest hotspot for COVID-19, with several districts in Tamil Nadu witnessing a spillover of cases. The infection has now spread to at least half of Tamil Nadu. As vendors tested positive for the virus, labourers including loadmen were affected in several districts. While the government managed to trace all index cases, contact tracing has proven to be a huge challenge. This was due to the massive crowding at the marketplace.Also read: Coronavirus | Traders to blame for Koyambedu market cluster, says Edappadi PalaniswamiPublic health officials say that, a person who tested positive had more than 200 contacts.

The never-ending rows of shops are empty, and an eerie silence has descended upon the sprawling area of 65 acres. The iron gates to the market are closed to prevent further spread of the novel coronavirus, but it is too little, too late. Keeping the market open till May 5 during a raging pandemic has proved costly for the Tamil Nadu government.Instead of maintaining physical distancing, people thronged the market during the nationwide lockdown without wearing masks. As a result, the huge market complex is now the State’s biggest COVID-19 cluster. With cases from the cluster spread over half of Tamil Nadu, Koyambedu has changed the State’s COVID-19 trajectory. Other States too have begun to report COVID-19-positive people with a known presence at Koyambedu, or who had contact with those in the market."

Henceforth, they would be seated in a glass booth and with camera and LED screen outside the terminal gates. The passengers have to show the documents to the camera and once the staff inside approve, they can enter the terminal, sources said. Officials of Airports of Authority of India (AAI) said all check-in counters have been wrapped with glass panels with a small window at its front, so airline staff don’t directly come in contact with passengers. Usually, airline staff issue boarding passes to passengers who come to the counter, but this may change too. AAI has planned to use alternative check-in counters to maintain physical distancing. An airline staff would inspect the ticket copy and identity proof from behind a glass pane. A machine issuing boarding passes would be in the next counter. After the details are keyed into the system, passengers could collect the pass from the machine.In addition to this, Bureau of Civil Aviation Security announced that stamping of boarding passes can be dispensed with. “We want to try and keep passengers and staff as safe as possible.

1559,UttarPradesh,"May 12, 2020 23:16 IST",Other States,SITAPUR,Lockdown leaves patients struggling for medical attention in U.P.’s Sitapur,"It’s about 3 p.m. and patients accompanied by their kin continue to trickle into the district hospital in Sitapur.Several police guards are stationed at the gate but no thermal screening is done for visitors, which includes a stray bull that heads straight to the dustbin within the hospital compound to forage for anything edible. At the hospital, only the emergency services are running. Some patients arrive in ambulances. At the entrance to the main hospital building, Nandlal Prajapati and a relative push a wheeled stretcher bearing his brother towards an ambulance. A female relative fans the patient to provide him some respite from the searing afternoon heat.Mr. Prajapati’s brother is suffering with an abdominal lump and has been referred to the Medical College in Lucknow, 90 km away. The family does not know what has caused the lump.This is the second time that Mr. Prajapati’s brother is set to be transferred to another hospital during the lockdown. A migrant worker in Delhi, he was brought to Sitapur in an ambulance after doctors in the national capital refused to operate on him as his family was not around. They could not travel to Delhi.“Toh phir isko ambulance karke sidha ghar pe laya gaya. Yahan kehte hai, iska ilaaj nahi hai (He was then brought home in an ambulance. Here (district hospital) they are telling us they can’t treat him),” said Mr. Prajapati, looking despondent.He said the hospital told him there were not enough beds to admit his brother. Several other patients, including a father-son duo who had suffered injuries after a roof collapsed on them during a recent thunderstorm, narrated similar stories of being referred to Lucknow for treatment that they had expected to get at the district hospital.In another corner of the hospital compound, which was built in 1886, Kamruddin and his family were sitting under a tree, their heads bowed in grief.A few hours earlier, his mother Raessa had died of internal injuries she suffered after being run over by a tractor trolley in a field. On Sunday evening at about 5:30 p.m., when a heavy thunderstorm hit parts of U.P., Kamruddin’s mother was out tending to the family’s goats as they grazed. Kamruddin alleges that after spending a night in the hospital when he stepped out for a cup of tea at 6 a.m., he was not allowed to re-enter the premises till 11 a.m. ostensibly to comply with social distancing norms. His mother reportedly died at 8 a.m. “They did not let me in even after the death. They said only one attendant can be with the patient. But there was no male present there,” he said, as he waited for his mother’s mortal remains.Kamruddin also alleged that the hospital lacked proper medical facilities to treat his mother. “You can complain as much as you want, but nothing happens,” he asserted.As he was speaking, Shubham Shukla, a student whose family owned the tractor that hit Raessa, tried to defend the hospital. He said the woman was provided all possible emergencyy services at the hospital but was too badly injured to survive. Perhaps out of a sense of obligation, Mr. Shukla had accompanied the family to the hospital. The injured woman was brought there on the same tractor from their village in Auliya block, 26 km away.While the people of U.P. observe the lockdown enforced to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic, they must also simultaneously deal with general illnesses and mishaps that are common in these parts. While touring the district, locals threw up anecdotes of how the restrictions during the lockdown were compounding their difficulties. Not only were doctors not always available at the community health centres and primary health centres due to COVID-19 duties, locals, especially those from rural areas, were facing logistical inconvenience due to the travel restrictions.Mr. Shukla had his own grievance. After his dog fell ill for four days, he attempted to take it to the hospital in his car but was stopped each time, after travelling barely kilometre. The police had told him to call the veterinarian home, he claimed.“Hospital jao toh ilaj nahi milta, ghar mein kaun ayega (We don’t get proper treatment even in a hospital, who is going to come home now),” he said.A few metres away, Ram Het, his wife Neelam and her mother-in-law were sitting outside on benches waiting for a motorcycle to arrive and take them home in Sanda, 50 km away. Neelam had fallen unconscious a few days earlier, following which she was brought to the district hospital in an ambulance. Her CT scan report was normal, much to the family’s relief. However, they now face the challenging prospect of journeying back home given the absence of public transport. “The bike will have to make two trips to take all of us,” said Mr. Het. “So I will call another bike. Till it arrives, I will walk,” he added.Many patients complained of being forced to walk a few miles in the sun if their homes were in the containment zone. The Khairabad kasba in Sitapur has been sealed as a hotspot. Residents in and around the area are the most inconvenienced. A week ago, Shamsuddin’s wife fell from the roof and fractured her hip. She was rushed to the district hospital from Khairabad in an ambulance. Shamsuddin says that not only does he have to step out to fetch medicines as they are not available locally, he has also been unable to get food directly supplied from his house for the patient as the route is cut off. However, he is lucky to have relatives, living not far away, who bring him food.“I have not been home for eight days. There is nobody else to stay here with her. They are not allowed to leave their area,” he said.The sealing of Khairabad has led to problems for many locals in the region, including Rajendra Kumar, who runs a small licensed medical shop in a village 6.5 km away. He is forced to travel 14 km to the district headquarters on cycle to get his supplies of medicine. Since he is unable to do it regularly, he doesn’t have enough stocks of essential medicines like paracetamol and painkillers. The barren shelves behind him reflect his predicament.“I can’t stock too much as they will expire. This is a rural area. These days I just refuse people if I don’t have the medicine they want,” he said.Unlike the district hospital, where visitors were not screened at the gate, at the entrance to Khairabad’s privately run BCM hospital every visitor’s temperature is checked digitally by staff in proper protective gear.Outside the gate, Murli, a farmer is forced to rest with his grandchild under the roof of a vacant roadside stall. His son is ill and being treated in the hospital but he has not been allowed to enter due to the social distancing restrictions. “My daughter is with him,” said Murli, who had to walk five km to reach the hospital. The patient, however, was brought on a two-wheeler. Only emergency OPD services are running at the hospital.“Crowding will increase if the OPD is open. We won’t be able to refuse people then,” explained a hospital staff.While the Sitapur Chief Medical Officer was unavailable for comment, District Hospital Superintendent Ajay Shukla dismissed allegations and complaints by patients that they were being turned away and referred to Lucknow unnecessarily. The procedure that existed earlier was in operation, he said. “We are not rejecting anyone. We only refer those with neurological problems or those who cannot be treated here,” he asserted.When asked why there was no thermal screening at the hospital, he said only those people who came and reported that they were running a fever were being screened.“This can’t be done for everyone. It is for those people who are coming from outside areas,” he said.To meet the paucity of available medical personnel, the district administration has released a list of doctors and their phone numbers to cater to the OPD requirements of people. The list includes psychiatric help. Mohini Jhawar, an activist who runs a mental health care organisation, listed by the administration for counselling during the pandemic, said she was mostly receiving calls from girls in shelter homes and transgender community people. Ms. Jhawar said many people were also calling her for counselling over the telephone, as they were unable to meet their appointments. “But we don’t provide telephonic treatment. We ask them to come in person, somehow,” she said.Ms. Jhawar also said that many people were reporting stress due to the uncertainty induced by the lockdown. For those living in rural areas of Sitapur and around, the latest thunderstorm had brought additional stress as many people’s homes had sustained damage to their roofs, she said.Chatrapal Yadav, a local lawyer, also said that he had been receiving distress calls from people alleging that they were not receiving treatment at the hospitals even for general illnesses.“People are having to return from the hospitals and health centres. Doctors are not available. They are considering only serious cases these days,” Mr. Yadav asserted."

The government will shut down any of those establishments in case of a spike in COVID-19 cases, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday. While 33 positive cases are reported in the last 24 hours, the testing numbers have gone up. A total of 1,397 persons have been tested in last 24 hours, while 119 patients are discharged, the State administration noted.Without specifying any date, Ms. Banerjee said lockdown would continue in Bengal for another month, with limited relief to certain sectors. She listed the sectors in a press conference.“Small neighbourhood shops for both essential and non-essential items, stand-alone electronic goods sellers but not big markets, stationery stores, paint shops, mobile and battery charging points, hardware, laundry and shops selling cigarettes or beetle leaf… tea shops will sell tea [leafs] but no casual chatting sitting in tea shops is allowed,” the Chief Minister said.Construction gets nodIndustries such as construction will be allowed in the green zone “provided they follow lockdown protocol.” The activity of Public Health Engineering (PHE) to be encouraged, while self-help groups (SHGs) will be engaged to make masks. This was one of the many suggestions made by the doctors’ associations to the Chief Minister at Tuesday’s meeting.“Since unemployment will be on the rise, with a growing demand of masks, we requested the Chief Minister if SHGs can be engaged to make masks. A protocol for mask making can be made,” said Rejaul Karim, a doctor who attended the meeting. Doctors’ plea The doctors asked for “more and sterilised PPEs,” separate treatment facility for health workers, ensuring opening of private facilities in the green zone.“Globally, epidemic identification and forecast research institutes work throughout the year to study viruses. The Indian Council of Medical Research [ICMR] has been doing it, perhaps we need one for the State and the Chief Minister was informed. She agreed to the idea on the face of it,” said Dr Karim.On Wednesday, Ms. Banerjee said that nearly half of 45 jute mills were allowed to operate and 25% of tea garden workers were back to work. She said that from next Monday, buses and taxis would be allowed to operate in the green zone “without plying between districts.”“In addition, 51 private hospitals are being asked to treat patients without fee. The government will bear the cost,” Ms. Banerjee said. However, the list of such hospitals is yet to be made public. The State has set up a task force to “examine and evaluate a six-monthly ₹1.52 lakh crore economic rehabilitation plan,” she said.Attacks BJPMs. Banerjee targeted the BJP for “spreading fake news.”“The attempt is to ensure that the total State machinery can be engaged to counter the false campaign run by the BJP. They are finding tiny loopholes in the functioning of the government — and there will always be small loopholes as this is a massive crisis — and blowing it up, to keep the government busy.“Like without any investigation, they made the dead body in a hospital go viral. There are dead bodies in hospitals, in mortuaries, and that does not indicate anything. A section of media is picking these inputs routinely. Please do not turn people hostile against us, this is not the time to score political brownies…do it when there is an election,” Ms. Banerjee said.‘Truth exposed’On Ms. Banerjee’s comment about the BJP’s approach to “fish in the muddy water,” party president Dilip Ghosh said the State administration was failing at every point and thus blaming the Opposition and the media.“The truth is getting exposed. Media is being stopped from narrating facts… but even then videos captured using mobile phones are exposing the truth. The news organisations are being threatened…“None of the helplines are working, ration and food is being distributed among Trinamool Congress cadres, the scheme for migrant workers not functioning properly,” said Mr. Ghosh. He sought another all-party meeting."

Even before the lockdown was announced in Kolkata, he put up a post on Facebook saying something should be done about the senior citizens living alone. He was motivated by the concerns raised by their children living in other cities or abroad. Within hours of putting up the post, he was anchoring a WhatsApp group of about 80 people called Let’s Help, each of the volunteering to help in some way or the other.Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India“On an average we are reaching medicines and groceries to five or six houses in a day. Volunteers are functioning in their respective neighbourhoods,” Mr. Datta, who works with the hospitality industry, told The Hindu. “The idea came to me because I too worry about my elderly mother when I am travelling — I can relate to the plight of those who are unable to visit their parents [because of the lockdown].”On Tuesday, ex-banker Mohammad Nehal and his lawyer friend Syed Ehtisham Huda also began a similar service. “I have already received some 25 calls, they are all on behalf of the elderly who need life-saving drugs,” said Mr. Nehal, even as he shopped for medicines at a store in South City Mall. He also put up a Facebook post calling for volunteers for this “humanity-first initiative”.During such as unprecedented lockdown, help, sometimes, is not just about reaching essentials to the needy. Luna Chatterjee, a brand strategist who is part of the Let’s Help group, has been assigned to stay in touch with an elderly couple, just to assure them that they are not alone.“They are total strangers — they are the parents of a friend’s friend who lives abroad — but I call them every day to let them know we are around. Such people don’t just need essential supplies, they also need people to talk to,” said Ms. Chatterjee.Sometimes, emergency situations are unprecedented in nature. “The other day we got to know of an elderly man living alone with four cats,” said Ms. Chatterjee. “His neighbours had poisoned the cats out of fear that they carried the virus. People instantly reached out to him and guided him to the veterinary hospital and even offered to accompany him if required. The vets, unfortunately, could save only two cats.”Such private citizens apart, the Kolkata police and the municipal corporation too are circulating messages on social media, offering help to Kolkatans who live abroad but have already relatives back home."

More than 80% of blood supply to 108 blood banks in the state, including 74 state run-facilities, are sourced from such camps, an official of Central Blood Bank said.“The blood banks are facing a severe shortage of supply. Just imagine the condition of thalassemia patients and others who need a regular transfusion of blood. It is a very difficult situation,” Bratish Niyogi, managing director of People’s Blood Bank told PTI. During summers, blood collection dips by nearly 40% but the situation has worsened due to the coronavirus outbreak, Mr. Niyogi said.“If someone needs blood of a specific type, he or she has to find a donor himself or herself as community clubs and the youth wings of political parties have stopped organising blood donation camps due to the lockdown,” he said. The shortage of blood supply has also affected surgeries.“Major surgeries that can be postponed have been advised to do so to keep the requirement of blood in check for the time being. The state needs an average of 1 lakh units of blood every month,” A. Ganguly, director of Lifeline Blood Bank said. D. Ashish, secretary of NGO Medical Bank, which has been involved in blood donation campaigns for over 40 years, said the situation is worse in the districts. When contacted, Health Minister Chandrima Bhattacharya said the State government is keeping a close watch on the situation and has come out with new guidelines regarding blood collection following the coronavirus outbreak."

1568,WestBengal,"March 31, 2020 02:22 IST",Other States,Kolkata,"Amidst lockdown and death, tea garden workers in Bengal demand wages","The lockdown for preventing the spread of the coronavirus could not have had come at a worse time for the tea gardens of north Bengal, for it coincided with the flush production of the Darjeeling tea industry. The first flush, which is harvested in March, and the second flush of May, are the biggest source of revenue for the tea gardens of the region, and till a few days ago, despite the lockdown, plucking of tea leaves continued in some gardens.The Tea Board of India on March 26 issued a circular clearing any confusion on the matter. The notification stated: “All tea gardens in the country are under lockdown and are not operational. Thereby, all stakeholders are advised not to take cognisance of the messages that are going around to the contrary in social media.”On Monday, when the first COVID-19 death was reported in north Bengal, several tea gardens’ unions demanded that an immediate lockdown was necessary in the tea gardens, but the State government should also ensure that workers were paid their wages. A 44-year old woman, a resident of Kalimpong, died at the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital in the early hours of Monday. She was the second coronavirus casualty in the State.Workers’ survival“An immediate lockdown of [tea] gardens is necessary, but with the survival of the workers in mind. We insist that employers should be made to pay full wages for the period of lockdown. As wages in tea gardens are generally paid on a weekly or fortnightly basis, the same procedure should be followed,” read a letter sent to the Chief Secretary of the State. The letter, sent on behalf of 19 organisations, including several tea garden unions that work for the Right to Food campaign in the State, highlights that West Bengal employs 2.5 to 3 lakh tea garden workers, thus supporting about 10-12 lakh people, and is the backbone of the economy of at least three districts in north Bengal — Darjeeling, Jalpiaguri and Alipurduar. Right to Food campaigners in the State also made a similar demand in a press release, noting, “Employers should be made to pay full wages for the period of lockdown. In case of default, State Government should pay the wages [and] should recover the amount from employers.” The campaigners said that such an effort would cost the State government ₹176 crore.‘Below survival’“Our experience regarding wages in tea gardens has not been good. Unless the State government intervenes, there can be no certainty about our wages, which in the industry have always been much below survival level ,” Binay Karketta, a prominent tea garden union leader based in Alipurduar, said. Mr. Karketta said that wages for a tea garden worker stands at only Rs.176 per day and dependence on the public distribution system could lead to hunger in isolated and farflung tea gardens.Saman Pathak, general secretary of the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), Darjeeling district, admitted that there was some confusion regarding whether the gardens would remain open or closed.“The industry will suffer but after the [COVID-19] death reported in the day, workers do not want to keep the gardens open. This will lead to further distress in the gardens. Unless the State is going to ensure wages, the situation will get from bad to worse,” Mr. Pathak said.The CITU leader said that tea gardens have a history of chronic hunger and remain one of the most backward regions of the State, and a total closure may dispel doom."

She was admitted to the hospital with a mild fever, which was certified as unrelated to coronavirus fever. However, she was kept overnight in a coronavirus isolation room “filled with people who were coughing”.“I have had a history of UTI (Urinary Tract Infection) and so I went to see the doctor after experiencing stomach pain. I visited two hospitals, KPC in Jadavpur and one in Tollygunge (Bangur Hospital) and they asked me to go to the Infectious Diseases [ID] Hospital in Beliaghata,” the woman said.‘No one listened’She was told at the Beliaghata ID Hospital that she did not have symptoms of the coronavirus and she was not admitted. “But I was again asked to return to Bangur and made to stay in the hospital for the night, among many patients who were coughing. I repeatedly said that I would catch the virus in the hospital, as I do not have it. But no one listened,” she told The Hindu. Moreover, she was asked if she was from China.Finally, her family members in Gangtok and her employers intervened. Ministers from Sikkim spoke to their counterparts in the West Bengal government and the authorities at the Bangur Hospital, after which she was discharged.The cabin crew member’s is not uncommon. Women with UTI are having a particularly harrowing time as UTI patients usually run a high fever. The key problem, however, is that people with high fever or a cold and cough are denied entry in medical facilities that are not treating coronavirus patients. This is becoming a “huge problem”, said doctors.If doctors are scared, who will fight the battle?A leading gastroenterologist thumped his desk when asked about non-admission of patients in health facilities.“This has now become a nightmare. When my patients are admitted with UTI-related fever or liver ailment-related fever, they are refused [treatment] by top private hospitals in the city,” he said, on condition of anonymity. Some nursing homes have also been shut down in view of the crisis.“If hospital managements, who have to be at the forefront of this battle, get scared, then who is going to fight and win it?” the doctor asked. He blamed hospital managements for refusing to treat patients with “plain fever” though doctors are “going to work”.The management of one private hospital said that they did “not have too many options other than to take precautionary measures”.Pradeep Ghosh, secretary of the Bengal Chemists and Druggists Association in North 24 Paraganas district said that doctors from Kolkata were not reaching the districts. “Local MBBS doctors are managing the situation for now as senior doctors and experts are not coming,” said Mr. Ghosh, who resides in Barrackpore, about 50 km from Kolkata."

Now, I cannot walk out of the college just like that. It’s my job to ensure safekeeping of the chemicals, so I kept returning to the college even after it shut. That’s when it struck me, why not use the stock of alcohol to make hand sanitisers,” Dr. Hari Shankar Biswas, head of the Chemistry Department at Surendranath College, told The Hindu.Sanitisers require pure alcohol — not what is sold in liquor shops — which only licence-holders can purchase. Luckily Dr. Biswas, who holds the licence on behalf of the college, had purchased sufficient amount of it shortly after Durga Puja.“With the permission of the principal and the help of colleagues, I took 30 litres of alcohol from the stock to make hand sanitiser. As per the WHO (World Health Organisation) guidelines, 100 ml of sanitiser must have 70 ml of alcohol — the remaining 30ml usually consists of water, glycerine and a dash of hydrogen peroxide,” Dr. Biswas said.He used rose water to give his product a fragrance, and also added a few drops of the dye methylene blue to impart a blue colour to it. Naming it Sparsha, he distributed some 500 bottles of 60 ml each among those who really needed it: non-teaching staff, policemen on duty outside the college, shops giving photocopies and printouts.Similar initiatives Dr. Biswas isn’t alone. Dr. Aparna Sen, head of the Microbiology Department at the Lady Brabourne College, also undertook a similar initiative. “I must thank our principal Prof. Siuli Sarkar. She gave us the go-ahead in spite of our limited resources. We managed to make 200 bottles of about 100 ml each. We used rose fragrance and gave the sanitiser a pink colour,” Dr. Sen said. She distributed some of the bottles among the non-teaching staff — “who travel in buses and trams and need them the most” — and on Monday, representatives from the local police station and the SSKM Hospital also came to the college to collect the product for use by their staff.Dr. Amrita Kar, Associate Professor in the Chemistry Department of Bethune College, also managed to make some 50 bottles of 60-70 ml each, using ethanol and distilled water. Most of the bottles were distributed among the non-teaching staff. “This is not rocket science, we are merely doing our duty in the time of a crisis,” Dr. Kar told The Hindu."

The Chief Minister said that similar measures should be tried in a few zones in Kolkata to ensure people stayed at home and maintained social distancing in markets.‘Very sensitive’Ms. Banerjee, who held a video conference meeting from the State Secretariat with senior officials of the State government, District Magistrates and Police Superintendents, said a number of areas in several districts had been designated “very sensitive, and sensitive”. The Chief Minister, whose government has been shying away from publicly announcing COVID-19 “hotspots”, for the first time mentioned Red, Orange and Green Zones — demarcations announced by the Central government to identify areas based on the number of cases of infections recorded.According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, there are 170 districts identified as hotspots under “Red Zone” classification to focus attention on districts/ cities reporting a large number of cases/ high growth rate in incidence of infections. According to the Ministry, there are four districts with large outbreaks in West Bengal — Kolkata, Howrah, Purba Medinipur and North 24 Parganas. ‘Huge crowds’ “The situation in Howrah is very bad. If from transmission within the family, it reaches the stage of community transmission, then a lot of people will be affected. If need be, armed police should be deployed in sensitive areas like the Howrah market, where huge crowds are gathering and social distances are not being maintained,” Ms. Banerjee said She referred to places like Howrah Urban, Malipanchghara, Dhulagarh, Shibpur and Sankrail as the highest risk areas in Howrah district and directed a complete lockdown in these areas. The Chief Minister also asked Kolkata Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma to post armed police personnel in certain areas of the city.“Stop social mixing, roadside chit-chats. Police should impose restrictions in markets in these areas. More than five people should not be allowed to queue up before a shop,” the Chief Minister said. She directed officials that Howrah should be in the “Orange Zone” in 14 days. Ms. Banerjee said that Purba Medinipur is already in the “Orange Zone”. According to the CM, in ten out of 23 districts in the State, not a single case of COVID-19 has been recorded.Later in the day, Ms. Banerjee visited a few ration shops in the city’s Bhawanipore area and took stock of the distribution of rations.

Till Saturday, the state had reported 233 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 12 deaths, far lower than other big states like Maharashtra, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh. The constitution of an expert audit committee to certify whether the deaths have occured due to the coronavirus pandemic or other underlying ailments, called comorbidity in medical parlance, instead by the doctors who treated them, has led to growing scepticism about the reliability of the state government data.Also read: West Bengal Governor says BJP MPs prevented from relief workThe National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), ICMR’s nodal COVID-19 testing facility in Kolkata, had recently said the state government is not sending enough samples for tests. There is a big drop. Last week we didnt even have 20 samples per day. Number of samples being sent is determined by the state government, so if they send more samples, we are able to test more. I think sample collection has not been as per the recommendation. So the number of tests being done in Bengal is also less, its director Dr Shanta Dutta had said recently. Responding to Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s complaint about the paucity of testing kits, she said ICMR has dispatched 42,500 kits to NICED so far and that there is no shortage. According to the state’s chief secretary Rajiva Sinha, a total of 4,630 samples have been tested by Saturday and West Bengal is now conducting over 400 tests every day. As of April 11, worst-hit Maharashtra had tested 31,841 samples, Rajasthan 24,817, Kerala 14,163 and Delhi 11,709. The number of COVID-19 positive cases given out by the state and the Centre are also at variance with each other. The West Bengal government said on Saturday that the number of those afflicted stood at 233, while the Union ministry of health and family welfare website put it at 287. Objecting to the formation of the committee to declare the cause of the death of a coronavirus patient, Union minister Babul Supriyo said only the doctors treating them should certify the reason for the death.“After all, everybody ultimately dies of heart failure.....multi organ failure,” he said, adding there has been an attempt to “hide” the COVID-19 cases and fatalities. Some senior medical practioners in Kolkata who spoke to PTI said the “hush-hush” approach is worsening things and hindering aggressive testing to tackle the disease effectively. The number of tests should be increased immediately in order to estimate the spread of the contagion. As most patients or suspects are asymptomatic, we need to have more sample testing, a senior physician said. Chief Secretary Sinha said the state has its own limitations as it cannot start testing in any laboratory because only the facilities authorised by the ICMR can conduct the COVID-19 test. In terms of testing, we have a limitation as we all know that the approval comes from ICMR. We got permission for the Malda unit only a few days back,” he said. He said permission has been sought to conduct the test at the medical college in Murshidabad, RG Kar Medical college and hospital, Kolkata, Burdwan Medical College and Bankura Medical College. The state currently has eight ICMR certified labs including NICED and the state-run SSKM hospital where COVID tests can be conducted. Opposition parties have accused the TMC government of not doing enough to stem the rise of coronavirus cases and hiding facts. If you go through state-wise data of big states, you will find the number of tests conducted here is far less than elsewhere. Despite the Centre providing testing kits in abundance, for reasons best known to the state government, they are conducting fewer tests,” West Bengal BJP president and MP Dilip Ghosh said.Mr. Ghosh said the state government has made a “mockery” of death figures by referring the matter of deceased patients to the audit committee. The leader of the Congress party in the Lok Sabha, Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, echoes his view. This demarcation of coronavirus and non-coronavirus deaths is a mechanism to hide facts, he said. He called the audit panel a “truth suppressing mechanism. Derek O’Brien, the TMC’s leader in the Rajya Sabha, claimed West Bengal’s numbers are better than most states as the government here has worked hard to contain the spread of the disease. We in Bengal are focussed on the task at hand. We are carrying on with our work. It is this that has ensured Bengal’s COVID-19 numbers are better than most. We have worked hard, been first movers and prepared early to keep these numbers low,” he told PTI. He admitted that it is a work in progress and there is no room for complacency.“The rumours and mischief have to be responded to - with facts, figures and public health logic. We are fighting Corona.

It said inconclusive results were “necessitating a repeat confirmatory test run, thereby causing a delay in generation of final test report”. There was no problem when testing kits were received directly from the National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, but recently, supplies to the government labs have been routed through ICMR- NICED, Kolkata, it added.Dr. Dutta said the initial kits were assembled by the NIV, where it standardised them with other reagents and controls and distributed them directly to other Virus Reserach Diagnostic Laboratories (VRDLs). “When the numbers of kit supply increased, it was difficult for the NIV to cope up with the demand. Then, the ICMR started procuring ready-made kits and supplied them to the VRDLs through 16 depots across the country”.State Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha also highlighted the issue of faulty testing kits.

On Sunday, Dr. Biplab Dasgupta, an Assistant Director in Health Services (in charge of stores and equipment), also succumbed to complications caused by COVID-19. But it is the death of Dr. Mandal — a popular figure in Kolkata — that has shaken the medical fraternity in the city, with doctors realising that they are at a far greater risk than they had imagined.Several doctors attached to private hospitals are now wondering whether it is worth going to work at all until the crisis blows over, even though no is willing to go on record to publicly express the fear weighing on their minds.Government doctors, on the other hand, can hardly entertain the thought of staying away from work because it is the question of their career and also livelihood, but at least one specialist — in the field of neuromedicine — at the Calcutta Medical College resigned soon after the pandemic broke out in the city because he didn’t want to put his life at risk.Also read | Coronavirus: Assistant Director of Bengal Health Services dies of suspected COVID-19“How does it feel when someone known to you, someone who’s been working with you, someone who until the other day was a walking-talking presence, is suddenly gone?

The government will shut down any of those establishments in case of a spike in COVID-19 cases, Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee said on Wednesday. While 33 positive cases are reported in the last 24 hours, the testing numbers have gone up. A total of 1,397 persons have been tested in last 24 hours, while 119 patients are discharged, the State administration noted.Without specifying any date, Ms. Banerjee said lockdown would continue in Bengal for another month, with limited relief to certain sectors. She listed the sectors in a press conference.“Small neighbourhood shops for both essential and non-essential items, stand-alone electronic goods sellers but not big markets, stationery stores, paint shops, mobile and battery charging points, hardware, laundry and shops selling cigarettes or beetle leaf… tea shops will sell tea [leafs] but no casual chatting sitting in tea shops is allowed,” the Chief Minister said.Construction gets nodIndustries such as construction will be allowed in the green zone “provided they follow lockdown protocol.” The activity of Public Health Engineering (PHE) to be encouraged, while self-help groups (SHGs) will be engaged to make masks. This was one of the many suggestions made by the doctors’ associations to the Chief Minister at Tuesday’s meeting.“Since unemployment will be on the rise, with a growing demand of masks, we requested the Chief Minister if SHGs can be engaged to make masks. A protocol for mask making can be made,” said Rejaul Karim, a doctor who attended the meeting. Doctors’ plea The doctors asked for “more and sterilised PPEs,” separate treatment facility for health workers, ensuring opening of private facilities in the green zone.“Globally, epidemic identification and forecast research institutes work throughout the year to study viruses. The Indian Council of Medical Research [ICMR] has been doing it, perhaps we need one for the State and the Chief Minister was informed. She agreed to the idea on the face of it,” said Dr Karim.On Wednesday, Ms. Banerjee said that nearly half of 45 jute mills were allowed to operate and 25% of tea garden workers were back to work. She said that from next Monday, buses and taxis would be allowed to operate in the green zone “without plying between districts.”“In addition, 51 private hospitals are being asked to treat patients without fee. The government will bear the cost,” Ms. Banerjee said. However, the list of such hospitals is yet to be made public. The State has set up a task force to “examine and evaluate a six-monthly ₹1.52 lakh crore economic rehabilitation plan,” she said.Attacks BJPMs. Banerjee targeted the BJP for “spreading fake news.”“The attempt is to ensure that the total State machinery can be engaged to counter the false campaign run by the BJP. They are finding tiny loopholes in the functioning of the government — and there will always be small loopholes as this is a massive crisis — and blowing it up, to keep the government busy.“Like without any investigation, they made the dead body in a hospital go viral. There are dead bodies in hospitals, in mortuaries, and that does not indicate anything. A section of media is picking these inputs routinely. Please do not turn people hostile against us, this is not the time to score political brownies…do it when there is an election,” Ms. Banerjee said.‘Truth exposed’On Ms. Banerjee’s comment about the BJP’s approach to “fish in the muddy water,” party president Dilip Ghosh said the State administration was failing at every point and thus blaming the Opposition and the media.“The truth is getting exposed. Media is being stopped from narrating facts… but even then videos captured using mobile phones are exposing the truth. The news organisations are being threatened…“None of the helplines are working, ration and food is being distributed among Trinamool Congress cadres, the scheme for migrant workers not functioning properly,” said Mr. Ghosh.

1604,WestBengal,"May 01, 2020 22:48 IST",Other States,India,Coronavirus | The mystery of the low COVID-19 numbers in West Bengal,"On March 17, West Bengal recorded its first case of COVID-19 when an 18-year-old student, who had returned from London, tested positive for the virus. The student had been admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Beliaghata General Hospital, located about a kilometre away from the Eastern Metropolitan bypass in Kolkata. Despite being thrust into the limelight, the primary referral hospital for COVID-19 cases remained quiet. People continued to walk in; the guards did not stop anyone. They did not even object to a television crew that headed to the building later that night.The next morning, however, there was frenetic activity at Nabanna, which houses the State Secretariat, when it became public knowledge that the student was the son of a senior official in the State Home Department. The student had been in contact with his parents and his driver after his return to India on March 15. His mother had attended office till March 17 and met senior officials, including the Home Secretary of West Bengal. To make matters worse, reports said that the student had delayed his visit to a testing centre and had visited a shopping mall in the city, despite government instructions that those returning from abroad must remain in quarantine for 14 days. Several officials were furious about this serious and dangerous lapse of judgment.Interactive map of confirmed coronavirus cases in India | State Helpline numbers for COVID-19Changing bulletinsNearly a week later, on March 23, West Bengal recorded its first COVID-19-related death when a 57-year-old succumbed to the virus. The case was a matter of concern as it was unclear where the man, a resident of Dum Dum and an employee of the Eastern Railways, had contracted the virus. His family denied Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s statement that he had travelled abroad. The confusion over his travel history also reflected in the Heath Department’s official bulletin: it simply did not say anything about his travel history. In fact, from that day onwards, the Health Department, in its bulletins on COVID-19, stopped carrying any details about the travel histories of the infected and dead. The daily bulletin, which was first released as early as February, was initially an important tool for keeping the people informed. However, as cases grew in the State, the bulletins were constantly altered — sometimes to omit certain details and at other times to add details. This not only caused confusion and panic, but also raised eyebrows about the government’s handling of the crisis.This was surprising given how Banerjee appeared to be making all the right moves in the beginning of the outbreak. Between the time of the first reported COVID-19 case and the first COVID-19-related death in West Bengal, the government issued dozens of notifications and orders. The most significant one was issued on March 22. Titled ‘Complete Safety Restriction’, it announced a complete lockdown in West Bengal from 5 p.m. on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a nationwide lockdown. A meeting of major political parties was called to discuss ways of fighting the deadly virus. The Chief Minister demanded special packages from the Centre and visited markets and hospitals. An image circulating on social media at the time showed her drawing circles on the road in front of a shop to demonstrate to people how to practise physical distancing. Regular meetings with senior health and district officials were broadcast live on local television news channels. The State government announced a ₹200 crore fund and urged people to donate to the State Emergency Relief Fund that had been set up to contain the crisis. Quarantine centres were set up in every district. A separate COVID-19 hospital was identified and made functional. The police appeared to be enforcing the lockdown strictly by arresting hundreds of violators in Kolkata alone.Coronavirus | As death toll rises Bengal government says those reportedly tested positive are subject to confirmationSetting up a task forceBut in the last few days of March, it became clear that the virus had spread to different parts of the State: a resident of Kalimpong in North Bengal died, several in Howrah succumbed to the infection, and Purba Medinipur and Nadia districts also registered cases. Between March 31 and April 2, the death toll jumped from two to seven. Those who had died had no confirmed travel history outside the country.On April 2, a committee of doctors engaged by the State government as a Special Task Force against COVID-19 met at the State Secretariat and announced that the death toll had increased to seven. However, within an hour, the government revised the number. Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said that the death toll was not seven but three, as four people who had died were admitted with “co-morbidities”. On April 3, the West Bengal government issued a notification announcing that an expert committee would be set up for “conducting audit of the suspected deaths due to COVID-19”. The committee’s task was to audit all those people who had died after testing positive for the virus and examine “whether they died of the viral infection or co-morbidities”. The two terms, ‘audit committee’ and ‘co-morbidities’, came to dominate the discourse on the pandemic in West Bengal over the next few weeks.Also read | Howrah station turns into “hellhole” for hundreds of stranded passengersMore and more reports of COVID-19-positive patients dying were published in the media, but the official death count remained low. This was because the audit committee was busy examining each and every case. The figures were updated only with its approval. Journalists, doctors and Central teams began raising questions about the committee’s method in arriving at the findings.The bulletins caused more suspicion about the accuracy of the numbers. On April 2 and 3, the government did not release the official bulletin. The April 4 bulletin had no column on COVID-19-related deaths. This continued for a couple of days until April 7, when the government finally re-introduced the column specifying how many had died in West Bengal of SARS-CoV-2."

The panel, he said, has formed a list of dos and don’ts for medical practitioners treating novel coronavirus cases and certifying deaths.“We analysed, researched and formed a list of recommendations for the doctors to treat and certify deaths because of COVID-19,” the member said.The committee will now on collect samples from hospitals for examination, and will give necessary suggestions to the health department, if there are new findings.“This panel will not certify any coronavirus-related death. We will now go for random collection of samples from hospitals. In case of any new or peculiar finding, we will inform the state health department and make our recommendations,” he said. The panel had earlier noted that there was scope for improvement in medical record-keeping at COVID-19 hospitals, following which Chief Secretary Rajiva Sinha said the health department would soon issue an advisory.“During our research we found that the death certificates were issued without following the norms set by the WHO and the ICMR for COVID-19 deaths. Those certificates should have included the immediate cause of death, antecedent cause of death and underlying cause of death.

1608,WestBengal,"May 04, 2020 18:31 IST",National,Kolkata,Coronavirus | A shelter house in Kolkata stretches itself to take care of pets of COVID-19 victim,"Shortly after Dr. Biplab Kanti Dasgupta, who was showing symptoms of COVID-19, was taken to an isolation ward, his wife and his son too began to run high temperature. It was then that his another son, locked down in Bengaluru, called up Love n Care, a Kolkata-based shelter that looks after abandoned and injured animals.“The son called to say that two dogs needed shelter. When I asked him what kind of dogs, he said one of them was a Spitz — and the moment he said that, I tried to cut the call saying we looked after only homeless animals. Then he pleaded with me to hear him out,” said Susmita Roy, an executive member of Love n Care.It was a sad situation: the caller’s father was already in hospital and it was a matter of time before his mother and brother were also admitted in isolation wards. Therefore, there would be no one to take care of their two dogs: the Spitz and a mongrel.Ms. Roy put up a post on Facebook seeking advice on what could be done. One man was kind enough to donate a set of personal protective equipment (PPE). “We looked up videos on YouTube to learn how to use PPE, following which our volunteers rescued the dogs,” Ms. Roy said.Dr. Dasgupta, an assistant director in the Health department in charge of stores and equipment, died shortly afterwards — the first doctor in West Bengal to succumb to COVID-19 infection. His two dogs are now being looked after by the shelter in Maheshtala, which at the moment houses 230 animals.During the lockdown, its volunteers have been feeding 200-300 stray dogs daily — dogs not in residential areas but in commercial or ‘office’ districts, where the animals survive off the generosity of canteens and shopkeepers and office-goers.Besides, the organisation has also been feeding the horses idling at the Maidan opposite Victoria Memorial. In normal times, these horses are at the service of tourists taking buggy rides around the Maidan. “We supply hay to them on a regular basis. We would also like to feed them carrots and grams, but these are difficult times. When horse owners themselves have very little to eat, we cannot be sure if the carrots or grams reach the horses,” Ms. Roy said.When asked if the number of animals meeting with accidents has come down due to the lockdown, she said: “On the contrary. Because there are hardly any people on the road, animals have started sitting in the middle of the roads and vehicles — because there is hardly any traffic — drive at a great speed. Only the other day we got two dogs that were badly injured, almost dead.”"

An FIR has been lodged and immediate closure ordered against a Kakurgachi-based testing lab. The lab has also been fined ₹10 lakh.“Inquiry has revealed that the said diagnostic laboratory did not have ICMR approval and was, hence, found to be doing concluding tests for COVID-19 illegally,” an order from Sanjay Bansal, Secretary, Health and Family Welfare Department, said. The order from the department earlier this week said a complaint was received from a member of the public that the lab was collecting swab samples for COVID-19 unauthorisedly. “Taking a serious view of the matter, the State government has ordered the closure/sealing of M/s Tribeni Clinics P-323, C I T Road Scheme VI, M, Kakurgachi, Kolkata - 7000054 along with a fine of ₹10,00,000 (Rupees ten lakh) under the relevant section of the West Bengal Clinical Establishment (Registration, Regulation and Transparency) Act, 2017,” the order states.

Interestingly, it is not directly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.“We are vegetable sellers. Life has not treated us well ever. But, what they did to us has made living so difficult,” said Mr. Saha, a father of three. To stop the spread of COVID-19, a big market in south Kolkata was shifted overnight. The action has uprooted over 500 vendors, including Mr. Saha, who sell daily consumables. The vendors are now relocated in the open on the highway connecting south Kolkata to the airport.“First, COVID-19 took away lives. Now, the administration is snatching our livelihood,” Mr. Saha said, carrying dozens of coconuts from a field. Standing by the field, some vendors explained their plight.“They [the Kolkata Municipal Corporation] first planned to shift us to this field. It is not big enough to accommodate the sellers; if the buyers come, there won’t be any space at all. But they shifted us here, reasoning that it was meant to avoid crowding at Kasba market,” said a relatively prosperous vegetable seller. But the nightmare came when the market was set up. Thunderstorms hit the city and left the field flooded. A canopy was erected, but the thunderstorm returned on the night of May 5.A few vendors listed their losses. “I lost 25 kg of puffed rice,” said one. A woman said she lost 100 eggs, and two brothers said they lost plenty of vegetables. Nearly everyone had lost something which would have “a huge impact because the market is down.” The vendors resfused to give their names fearing “backlash” from the Bazar committee run by the Trinamool Congress (TMC).”Bijan Lal Mukherjee, TMC councillor of Ward 67 who planned the relocation, denied the allegation. “The objective is to save people’s life or consumables,” he said. Asked how a mid-sized football field could have ensured the safety of a few thousand consumers and vendors, he argued that the field is 13,000 square feet.“I had a proper plan which could have ensured the safety of all, but the rain spoiled everything. It is bad luck,” he said. A TMC supporter put the plan down to the “differences” between former CPI(M) member Swapan Chakravarty, who was with the TMC previously, and Mr. Mukherjee. “The field is controlled by Mr. Chakravarty, while Mr. Mukherjee wants to take control of it. He shifted the market and the people suffered,” he said. Mr. Mukherjee said his party had nothing to do with the decision."
